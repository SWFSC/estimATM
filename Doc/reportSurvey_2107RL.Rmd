# Introduction {#introduction}

The `r survey.name.long` (`r survey.name`) was conducted by the Fisheries Resources Division (FRD) of the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) aboard NOAA Ship *`r survey.vessel.long`* (hereafter, *`r survey.vessel`*) (**Fig.** \@ref(fig:vessel-pic)), `r survey.start` to `r survey.end` `r survey.year`. The Acoustic-Trawl Method (ATM) is routinely used to assess coastal pelagic fish species (CPS) and krill within the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), between Vancouver Island, British Columbia and San Diego, CA. In 2021, for the first time, the survey extended southward to central Baja California, Mexico. Data were collected using multi-frequency echosounders, surface trawls, obliquely integrating net tows, a continuous underway fish-egg sampler (CUFES), and conductivity-temperature-depth probes (CTDs).

The objectives for the survey were to: 1) acoustically map the distributions and estimate the abundances of CPS, i.e., Pacific Sardine *Sardinops sagax*, Northern Anchovy *Engraulis mordax*, Pacific Herring *Clupea pallasii*, Pacific Mackerel *Scomber japonicus*, and Jack Mackerel *Trachurus symmetricus*; and krill (euphausiid spp.); 2) characterize and investigate linkages to their biotic and abiotic environments; and 3) gather information regarding their life histories (**Fig.** \@ref(fig:vessel-pic)).

The survey domain was defined primarily by the modeled distribution of potential habitat for the northern subpopulation (stock) of Pacific Sardine [@Zwolinski2011]. This area was chosen to encompass the anticipated distributions of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine and the central stock of Northern Anchovy off the west coasts of the U.S. and Mexico, from approximately `r survey.landmark.s`, to `r survey.landmark.n`, but also spanned portions of the stocks of Pacific Mackerel and Jack Mackerel.

This report provides an overview of the survey objectives and a summary of the survey equipment, sampling, and preliminary results from data collected in Mexican waters. This report does not include estimates of the animal distributions and biomasses, which are documented separately. The final report will be provided no later than `r ymd("2021-10-04")+years(1)`.  

**This survey was conducted with the approval of the Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores (SRE, Diplomatic note CTC/1312/2021), the INEGI (Permit: XXX), CONAPESCA (Permit: XXX) and SEMARNAT (Permit: XXX).**

# Methods {#methods}
## Survey region and design {#methods-survey-design}

The SWFSC’s ATM surveys of CPS in the CCE began in 2006 with a focus on the northern stock of Pacific Sardine. Since then, they have expanded in scope and objectives to include the larger forage-fish assemblage and krill. This evolution, and the migratory behavior of Pacific Sardine, serve to explain the present survey region and design.  

During spring, the northern stock of Pacific Sardine typically aggregates offshore of central and southern California to spawn [@Demer2012, and reference therein]. During summer, if the stock is large enough, adults will migrate north, compress along the coast, and feed in the upwelled regions (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-distribution)**).  

During `r tolower(survey.season)` `r survey.year`, the west coast of the United States was surveyed using _`r survey.vessel`_ and _Long Beach Carnage_. Compulsory transects were nearly perpendicular to the coast with separations of 15 (south of Pt. Conception) to 20 nmi (north of Pt. Conception). The survey began off `r survey.landmark.s`, and progressed northwards toward `r survey.landmark.n`. Irrespective of the size of the stock and the extent of its migration, the northern stock of Pacific Sardine tends to reside within its potential habitat [@Zwolinski2011].  

The planned transects (**Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**) spanned the latitudinal extent of the potential habitat of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine^[https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/sardine_habitat_modis.html] at the time of the survey (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-habitat)**). The offshore extent of planned transects was adjusted during the survey according to the observed distribution of putative CPS backscatter in the echosounders, CPS eggs in CUFES samples, or CPS caught in trawls. To estimate CPS biomass near shore, where it is too shallow to navigate NOAA ships safely, sampling from _`r survey.vessel`_ was augmented with echosounder and purse-seine sampling from F/V _Long Beach Carnage_ south of Pt. Conception and around Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands (**Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**).

The dashed and dotted lines represent, respectively, the approximate summer and spring positions of the 0.2 mg m^–3^ chlorophyll-a concentration isoline. This isoline appears to oscillate in synchrony with the transition zone chlorophyll front [TZCF, @Polovina2001] and the offshore limit of the northern stock Pacific Sardine potential habitat [@Zwolinski2011]. Mackerels are found within and on the edge of the same oceanographic  habitat [e.g., @Demer2012; @Zwolinski2012]. The TZCF may delineate the offshore and southern limit of both Pacific Sardine and Pacific Mackerel distributions, and juveniles may have nursery areas in the Southern California Bight (SCB), downstream of upwelling regions.

## Acoustic sampling {#methods-acoustic-sampling}
### Echosounders {#methods-echosounders}  

On _`r survey.vessel`_, multi-frequency EK80 Wideband Transceivers (18-, 38-, 70-, 120-, 200-, and 333-kHz WBTs; Simrad) were configured with split-beam transducers (`r echo.models`, respectively; Simrad). The transducers were mounted on the bottom of a retractable keel or "centerboard" (**Fig. \@ref(fig:cb-config)**). The keel was retracted (transducers ~`r cb.retracted`-m depth) during calibration, and extended to the intermediate position (transducers ~`r cb.intermediate`-m depth) during the survey. Exceptions were made during shallow water operations, when the keel was retracted; or during times of heavy weather, when the keel was extended (transducers ~`r cb.extended`-m depth) to provide extra stability and reduce the effect of weather-generated noise (**Appendix \@ref(appendix-cb-pos)**). Transducer position and motion were measured at 5 Hz using an inertial motion unit (POS-MV, Trimble/Applanix).

On _Long Beach Carnage_, the SWFSC's multi-frequency echosounders (38-, 70-, 120-, and 200-kHz EK60 GPTs; Simrad) were configured with the SWFSC's multi-frequency transducer array (MTA4) with split-beam transducers (ES38-12, ES70-7C, ES120-7C and ES200-7C; Simrad) mounted on the bottom of a pole (**Fig. \@ref(fig:cb-config-lbc)**).

### Calibrations {#methods-echosounder-calibration}  

[**According to Josiah, no impedance measurements were made prior to the survey.**]  

The echosounder systems on each vessel were calibrated using the standard sphere technique [@Foote1987;@Demer2015]. On _`r survey.vessel`_, each WBT was calibrated in both CW (i.e., continuous wave or chirp mode) and FM modes (i.e., frequency modulation or broadband mode). The reference target was a `r cal.sphere`; calibrations of WBTs in FM mode used both the WC38.1 and a smaller 25-mm WC sphere. On each vessel, GPTs or WBTs were configured using the calibration results via the control software (EK80 `r ek80.version`, Simrad; see **Section \@ref(results-echosounder-calibration)**).  

### Data collection {#methods-acoustic-data-collection}  

Computer clocks were synchronized with the GPS clock (UTC) using synchronization software (NetTime^[http://timesynctool.com]). On _`r survey.vessel`_, the 18-kHz GPT, operated by a separate PC from the other echosounders, was programmed to track the seabed and output the detected depth to the ship’s Scientific Computing System (SCS). The 38-, 70-, 120-, 200-, and 333-kHz echosounders were controlled by the ER60 Adaptive Logger [EAL^[https://swfsc.noaa.gov/eal/] **[Update URL]**, @Renfree2016]. The EAL optimizes the pulse interval based on the seabed depth, while avoiding aliased seabed echoes, and was programmed such that once an hour the echosounders would operate in passive mode and record three pings, for obtaining estimates of the background noise level. Acoustic sampling for CPS-density estimation along the pre-determined transects was limited to daylight hours (approximately between sunrise and sunset).  

Measurements of volume backscattering strength ($S_v$; dB re 1 m^2^ m^-3^) and target strength ($TS$, dB re 1 m^2^), indexed by time and geographic positions provided by GPS receivers, were logged to 60 m beyond the detected seabed range or to a maximum of `r raw.log.range` m and stored in Simrad .raw format with a `r raw.size`-MB maximum file size. During daytime and nighttime, the echosounders were set to operate in CW and FM modes, respectively. For each acoustic instrument, the prefix for the file name is a concatenation of the survey name (e.g.,  `r survey.name`), the operational mode (CW or FM), and the logging commencement date and time from the EK80 software. For example, a file generated by the Simrad EK80 software (`r ek80.version`) for a WBT operated in CW mode is named `2103RL-CW-D2021723-T125901.raw`.   

To minimize acoustic interference, transmit pulses from the EK60, EK80, ME70, MS70, SX90, and the acoustic Doppler current profiler (Ocean Surveyor Model OS75 ADCP, Teledyne RD Instruments) on _`r survey.vessel`_ were triggered using a synchronization system (K-Sync, Simrad). The K-Sync trigger rate, and thus echosounder ping interval, was modulated by the EAL using the 18-kHz seabed depth provided by the SCS. During daytime, the ME70, SX90, and ADCP were operated continuously, while the MS70 was only operated at times when CPS were present. At nighttime, only the EK60, EK80, and ADCP were operated. All other instruments that produce sound within the echosounder bandwidths were secured during daytime-survey operations. Exceptions were made during stations (e.g., plankton sampling and fish trawling) or in shallow water when the vessel's command occasionally operated the bridge's 50- and 200-kHz echosounders (Furuno), the Doppler velocity log (Model SRD-500A, Sperry Marine), or both. Transmit pulses from the survey echosounders and fishing sonars aboard _Long Beach Carnage_ were not synchronized.  

### Data processing {#methods-acoustic-data-processing}  

Echoes from schooling CPS and plankton (**Figs. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)a, d**) were identified using a semi-automated data processing algorithm implemented using Echoview software (`r ev.version`; Echoview Software Pty Ltd). The filters and thresholds were based on a subsample of echoes from randomly selected CPS schools. The aim of the filter criteria is to retain at least 95% of the noise-free backscatter from CPS while rejecting at least 95% of the non-CPS backscatter (**Fig. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)**). Data from _`r survey.vessel`_ were processed using the following steps:  

1. Match geometry of the 70-, 120-, 200-, and 333-kHz $S_v$ to the 38-kHz $S_v$;
2. Remove passive-mode pings;
3. Estimate and subtract background noise using the background noise removal function [@DeRobertis2007] in Echoview (**Figs. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)b, e**);
4. Average the noise-free $S_v$ echograms using non-overlapping 11-sample by 3-ping bins;
5. Expand the averaged, noise-reduced _S~v~_ echograms with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation;
6. For each pixel, compute: $S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$, $S_{v,\mathrm{120kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$, and $S_{v,\mathrm{70kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$;
7. Create a Boolean echogram for $S_v$ differences in the CPS range: $-13.85 < S_{v,\mathrm{70kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 9.89 \text{ and} -13.5 < S_{v,\mathrm{120kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 9.37 \text{ and} -13.51 < S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 12.53$;
8. Compute the 120- and 200-kHz Variance-to-Mean Ratios [$VMR_{\mathrm{120kHz}}$ and $VMR_{\mathrm{200kHz}}$, respectively, @Demer2009] using the difference between noise-filtered $S_v$ (Step 3) and averaged $S_v$ (Step 4);
9. Expand the $VMR_{\mathrm{120kHz}}$ and $VMR_{\mathrm{200kHz}}$ echograms with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation;
10. Create a Boolean echogram based on the $VMR$s in the CPS range: $VMR_{\mathrm{120kHz}}$ > -65 dB and $VMR_{\mathrm{200kHz}}$ > -65 dB. Diffuse backscattering layers have low $VMR$ [@Zwolinski2010] whereas fish schools have high $VMR$ [@Demer2009];
11. Intersect the two Boolean echograms to create an echogram with "TRUE" samples for candidate CPS schools and "FALSE" elsewhere;
12. Mask the noise-reduced echograms using the CPS Boolean echogram (**Figs. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)c, f**);
13. Create an integration-start line `r int.start` m below the transducer (~10 m depth);
14. Create an integration-stop line `r adz.range` m above the estimated seabed [@Demer2009], or to the maximum logging range (e.g., `r int.stop` m), whichever is shallowest;
15. Set the minimum $S_v$ threshold to -60 dB (corresponding to a density of approximately three 20-cm-long Pacific Sardine per 100 m^3^);
16. Integrate the volume backscattering coefficients ($s_V$, m^2^ m^-3^) attributed to CPS over 5-m depths and averaged over 100-m distances;
17. Output the resulting nautical area scattering coefficients ($s_A$; m^2^ nmi^-2^) and associated information from each transect and frequency to comma-delimited text (.csv) files.

Data from _Long Beach Carnage_ were processed using the following steps **[check these]**:  

1. Remove shorter-duration, transient noise (e.g., ship’s asynchronous sonar) using the Impulse Noise Removal operator;
2. Remove longer-duration, transient noise (e.g., wave-hull collisions) using the Transient Noise Removal operator;
3. Compensate attenuated signals (e.g., from air-bubble attenuation) using the Attenuated Signal Removal operator;
4. Average the noise-free $S_v$ echograms using non-overlapping 11-sample by 3-ping bins;
5. Compute the $VMR$ using the difference between noise-filtered $S_v$ (Step 3) and averaged $S_v$ (Step 4);
6. Create a Boolean echogram mask using $VMR$ > -48 dB;
7. Expand the Boolean mask with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation;
8. Performs Steps 12-17 from _`r survey.vessel`_ processing.
9. Data from the USVs were processed using the following:
10. Match geometry of the $S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}$ to the $S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$;
11. Remove passive-mode pings;
12. Perform Steps 3-5 from _`r survey.vessel`_ processing;
13. For each pixel, compute: $S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$;
14. Create a Boolean echogram for $S_v$ differences in the CPS range: $-3 < S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 9.37$
15. Perform Steps 8-9 from _`r survey.vessel`_ processing;
16. Create a Boolean echogram mask using $VMR$ > -57 dB;
17. Performs Steps 11-17 from _`r survey.vessel`_ processing.  

When necessary, the start and stop integration lines were manually edited to exclude reverberation due to bubbles, to include the entirety of shallow CPS aggregations, or to exclude seabed echoes.

## Trawl sampling {#methods-trawl-sampling}  

During the day, CPS form schools, typically in the upper mixed layer [e.g., to 70-m depth in the spring, @Kim2005], and generally shallower in summer. After sunset, CPS schools tend to ascend and disperse; at that time, with reduced visibility and no schooling behavior, they are less able to avoid a net [@Mais1974]. Therefore, trawl sampling for identifying the species composition and length distributions of acoustic targets was performed at night.  

The net, a Nordic 264 rope trawl (NET Systems; Bainbridge Island, WA; **Figs. \@ref(fig:trawl-diagrams)a, b**), has a rectangular opening in the fishing portion of the net with an area of approximately 300 m^2^ (~15-m tall x 20-m wide), variable-sized mesh in the throat, an 8-mm square-mesh cod-end liner (to retain a large range of animal sizes), and a "marine mammal excluder device" to prevent the capture of large animals, such as dolphins, turtles, or sharks [@Dotson2010]. The trawl doors are foam-filled and the trawl headrope is lined with floats so the trawl tows at the surface.  

Up to three nighttime (i.e., 60 min after sunset to 30 min before sunrise) surface trawls, typically spaced 5-10 nmi-apart, were conducted in areas where echoes from putative CPS schools were observed in echograms or eggs were observed in the CUFES earlier that day. Each evening, trawl locations were selected by an acoustician who monitored CPS echoes and a member of the trawl group who measured the densities of CPS eggs in CUFES samples. The locations were provided to the watch officers who charted the proposed trawl sites. Trawl locations were selected using the following criteria, in descending priority: CPS schools in echograms that day, CPS eggs in CUFES samples that day, and the trawl locations and catches during the previous night. If no CPS echoes or CPS eggs were observed along the transect(s) that day, the trawls were alternatively placed nearshore one night and offshore the next night, with consideration given to the seabed depth and the modeled distribution of Pacific Sardine habitat.  

**[Check these steps; took details from latest draft of project instructions]** Trawls were towed at ~4 kn for 45 min. The total catch from each trawl was weighed and sorted by species or groups. From the catches with CPS, specimens were selected randomly for each of the target species (up to 75 for Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy and up to 50 for Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Herring). Those were weighed and measured to either their standard length ($L_S$; mm) for Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy, or fork length ($L_F$; mm) for Jack Mackerel, Pacific Mackerel, and Pacific Herring. In addition, sex and maturity were recorded for up to 75 specimens from Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy and up to 25 for Pacific and Jack Mackerels. Ovaries were preserved for up to 10 specimens of each CPS species except Pacific Herring. For Northern Anchovy, whole ovaries were preserved for up to 10 immature specimens (maturity code 1), up to 10 mature specimens (maturity codes 2-4), and up to 10 specimens with hydrated ovaries. ~~Fin clips were removed from 50 Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy specimens each from five different geographic zones (designated by J. Hyde and M. Craig, SWFSC) and preserved in ethanol for genetic analysis.~~ **[Instructions don't mention fin clips during spring; please confirm]** Otoliths were removed from up to 50 Pacific Sardine in the subsample; for other CPS species (except Pacific Herring), 25 otoliths were removed "as equally as possible" from the range of sizes present. The combined catches in up to three trawls per night (i.e., trawl cluster) were used to estimate the proportions of species contributing to the nearest samples of acoustic backscatter.  

## Purse seine sampling {#methods-seine-sampling}  

Purse seines were set to provide information about size, age, and species composition of fishes observed in the echosounders mounted on the fishing vessels that sampled the nearshore region. _Long Beach Carnage_ used an approximately 200 m-long and 27 m-deep net with 17 mm-wide mesh; a small section on the back end of the net had 25 mm-wide mesh (R. Ashley, pers. comm.). All collected specimens were frozen and later processed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW).  

**[Check these steps]** A maximum of **three** sets per day was planned during daylight hours. In the event of abundant CPS or an unsuccessful daytime set, a set was made at night. For each set, three dip net samples, spatially separated as much as possible, were collected, and specimens were frozen for later analysis by CDFW biologists. The total weight (tons) of the school was estimated by the captain. After the survey, each dip net sample was sorted, weighed, and counted to provide a combined weight and count for each species. Next, all three dip net samples were combined and up to 50 specimens were randomly sampled to provide a combined weight for each set. The length (mm; $L_S$ for Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy and $L_F$ for all others) and weight was measured for up to 50 randomly selected specimens of each species. Otoliths were extracted and macroscopic maturity stage was determined visually. Since samples were frozen, no gonad samples from female specimens were analyzed.

## Ichthyoplankton and oceanographic sampling {#methods-other-sampling}
### Egg and larva sampling {#methods-egg-sampling}  

During the day, fish eggs were collected using a CUFES [@Checkley1997], which collects water and plankton at a rate of ~640 l min^-1^ from an intake on the hull of the ship at ~3-m depth. The particles in the sampled water were sieved by a 505-$\mu$m mesh. Pacific Sardine, Northern Anchovy, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Hake (_Merluccius productus_) eggs were identified to species, counted, and logged. Eggs from other species (e.g., Pacific Mackerel and flatfishes) were also counted and logged as "other fish eggs". Typically, the duration of each CUFES sample was 30 min, corresponding to a distance of 5 nmi at a speed of 10 kn. Because the durations of the initial egg stages is short for most CPS, the egg distributions inferred from CUFES samples indicate the nearby presence of actively spawning fish.  

**[Confirm that bongo samples were collected; ad hoc samples are mentioned in the PIs, but no events in the SCS]** A CalCOFI bongo oblique net [a bridleless pair of 71-cm diameter nets with 505-$\mu$m mesh, @Smith1977] was used opportunistically to sample ichthyoplankton and krill after sunset, to contribute to the CalCOFI ichthyoplankton time series. Where there was adequate depth, 300 m of wire was deployed at a rate of 50 m min^-1^ and then retrieved at 20 m min^-1^, at a nominal wire angle of 45$^\circ$. Bongo samples were stored in 5% buffered formalin.  

### Conductivity and temperature versus depth (CTD) sampling {#methods-ctd-sampling}  

Conductivity and temperature were measured versus depth to `r ctd.depth` m using calibrated sensors on a CTD rosette or underway probe (UnderwayCTD, or UCTD; Teledyne Oceanscience) cast from the vessel. These data were used to estimate the time-averaged sound speed [@Demer2004c], for estimating ranges to the sound scatterers, and frequency-specific sound absorption coefficients, for compensating signal attenuation of the sound pulse between the transducer and scatterers [@Simmonds2005]. These data indicate the depth of the surface mixed layer, above which most epipelagic CPS reside during the day, which is later used to determine the integration-stop depth during acoustic data processing.  

# Results {#results}
## Echosounder calibrations {#results-echosounder-calibration}  

For _`r survey.vessel`_, the EK80s were calibrated on `r cal.datetime` while the vessel was alongside the pier near `r cal.loc` (`r cal.lat.dd` $^\circ$N, `r cal.lon.dd` $^\circ$W). Measurements of sea-surface temperature ($t_w$ = `r cal.temp` $^\circ$C) and salinity ($s_w$ = `r cal.sal` psu) were measured to a depth of 10 m using a handheld probe (Pro2030, YSI) and input to the WBT-control software (EK80 `r ek80.version`, Simrad), which derived estimates of sound speed ($c_w$ = `r cal.c` m s^-1^) and absorption coefficients (see **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results)**). Varying with tide, the seabed was approximately `r cal.min.z` to `r cal.max.z` m beneath the transducers. The calibration spheres were positioned in the far-field of each transducer, at 3.5- to 7-m range. WBT information, settings, and calibration results are presented in **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results)**. Measurements of beam-compensated sphere target strength relative to the theoretical target strength ($TS_{rel}$, dB re 1 m^2^) are presented in **Fig. \@ref(fig:tsc-plot)**. Measurements of gain, beamwidth, and offset angles from WBTs operated in FM mode are presented in **Fig. \@ref(fig:cal-plot-fm)**.

For _Lisa Marie_, the echosounders were calibrated using the standard sphere technique with a WC38.1 **in a tank at the SWFSC**. Beam model results were entered into the GPT-control software and are presented in **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results-lm)**.  

(ref:cal-results-lm) General purpose transceiver (EK60 GPT, Simrad) beam model results estimated from an in situ calibration of echosounders aboard _Lisa Marie_ using a WC38.1. Prior to the survey, calibrated on-axis gain ($G_0$), beam angles and angle offsets, and $S_a$ Correction ($S_\mathrm{a}\mathrm{corr}$) values were entered into the GPT-control software (EK80, Simrad).

## Data collection {#results-data-collection}
### Acoustic and net sampling {#results-acoustic-trawl-sampling}  

```{r load-nearshore-nasc-summary}
load(here("Output/purse_seine_sets.Rdata"))
load(here("Output/nasc_summ_tx_ns.Rdata"))

nasc.summ.lbc.ns <- filter(nasc.summ.ns, vessel.name == "LBC")
nasc.summ.lm.ns <- filter(nasc.summ.ns, vessel.name == "LM")
```  

The core survey region spanned an area from approximately `r survey.landmark.n`, to `r survey.landmark.s` (**Fig. \@ref(fig:station-sampling)**). _`r survey.vessel`_ sampled `r nrow(nasc.summ)` east-west transects totaling `r prettyNum(sum(nasc.summ$distance), digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` nmi, and conducted `r nrow(trawl.summ)` Nordic trawls.  

The nearshore region spanned an area from approximately Cape Flattery to San Diego, including around Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands, and was surveyed by _Long Beach Carnage_  and _Lisa Marie_ (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-ns)**). 

A total of `r nrow(nasc.summ.lm.ns)` east-west transects totaling `r sprintf("%.0f",sum(nasc.summ.lm.ns$distance))` nmi and `r nrow(lm.sets)` purse seine sets were completed by _Lisa Marie_ between Cape Flattery and Bodega Bay.  

A total of `r nrow(nasc.summ.lbc.ns)` east-west transects totaling `r sprintf("%.0f",sum(nasc.summ.lbc.ns$distance))` nmi and `r nrow(lbc.sets)` purse seine sets were completed by _Long Beach Carnage_ between Bodega Bay and San Diego, and around the islands in the SCB.  

**Leg I**  

On 20 March, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego at ~1400 (all times UTC). Acoustic sampling commenced from south to north along transect 002. On 1 April, acoustic sampling ceased after the sampling the middle portion of transect 010 off Point Mugu, CA and transited to Dana Point, CA to transfer scientific personnel to complete Leg I.  

**Leg II**  

On 1 April, _`r survey.vessel`_ resumed sampling along transect 012 near Santa Barbara, CA. On 12 April, acoustic sampling ceased after the completion of transect 028 off Bodega Bay, CA. On 16 April, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at Pier 30/32 in San Francisco, CA at ~1700 to complete Leg II.  

During Legs I and II, _`r survey.vessel`_ coordinated with _Long Beach Carnage_, which sampled the nearshore region between San Diego and Pt. Conception, and around Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands.  

### Ichthyoplankton and oceanographic sampling {#results-other-sampling}  

A total of `r nrow(ctd.sta)` CTD casts and `r nrow(uctd.sta)` UCTD casts were conducted, and `r prettyNum(nrow(cufes.raw), digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` CUFES samples were collected underway. The locations of CTD and UCTD stations are presented in **Fig. \@ref(fig:station-sampling)** and **Appendix \@ref(appendix-ctd-sampling)**.  

## Distribution of CPS {#results-cps-distribution}
### Core region  

Acoustic backscatter sampled by  _`r survey.vessel`_ and ascribed to CPS (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)a**)  was observed throughout the survey area, but was most prevalent south of San Francisco and in the offshore portion of transects south of Pt. Conception. Backscatter from CPS was conspicuously absent along the inshore portions of transects south of Long Beach, CA.  

Northern Anchovy eggs were observed throughout the survey region south of Monterey Bay, but were most abundant in CUFES samples along the offshore portions of transects in the Southern CA Bight, coincident with backscatter ascribed to CPS (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)b**). Few Pacific Sardine eggs were observed, mostly around the southeast coast of Santa Catalina Island (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)b**). No Jack Mackerel eggs were observed.  

Northern Anchovy catches were predominant, by weight, in trawl samples collected throughout the survey area (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**). Jack Mackerel were present in several trawls offshore in the SCB, and one near Long Beach (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**). Pacific Sardine were caught in nine trawls; however, catches were small and not visible except in one trawl haul offshore of the northern Channel Islands (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**). Pacific Mackerel were caught in two hauls in the SCB but also not visible at this scale (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**). Overall, the `r nrow(trawl.summ)` trawls captured a combined `r prettyNum(haul.CPS.kg, digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` kg of CPS (`r prettyNum(haul.Sardine.kg, digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` kg Pacific Sardine, `r prettyNum(haul.Anchovy.kg, digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` kg Northern Anchovy, `r prettyNum(haul.JackMack.kg, digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` kg Jack Mackerel, and `r prettyNum(haul.PacMack.kg, digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` kg Pacific Mackerel; **Appendix \@ref(appendix-trawl-sampling)**).  

### Nearshore region  

Acoustic backscatter sampled by _Long Beach Carnage_ and ascribed to CPS was observed throughout the nearshore survey area, but was most prevalent between Santa Barbara and Malibu, between Costa Mesa and La Jolla, and around Santa Cruz Island (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-ns)a**).  

Northern Anchovy and Pacific Sardine were the predominant CPS collected in purse seines set by _Long Beach Carnage_ (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-ns)b**). A few purse seine samples contained Pacific Mackerel south of Long Beach (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-ns)b**).

# Discussion {#discussion}  

The principal objectives of the `r survey.das`-day, Spring 2021 CCE Survey were to survey the central stock of Northern Anchovy and the northern stock of Pacific Sardine. Then, as possible, survey Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, Pacific Herring, and the southern stock of Pacific Sardine. With the benefit of favorable weather and few technical problems, _`r survey.vessel`_ surveyed the entire planned area from the northern end of Vancouver Island to San Diego. South of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, all transects were spaced `r adaptive.spacing`-nmi apart. The coordinated sampling with fishing vessels and USVs expanded the survey area into previously unsampled regions.  

**Other topics to discuss**

+ Variability/randomness of purse seine set locations.
+ Sensitivity of nearshore results to purse seine catch, if sets were not random.
+ Other?
