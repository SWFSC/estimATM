# 1 - Create a column with deep CPS NASC (cps.nasc)
-Done, new column cps.nasc.deep added to nasc.nearshore
# 2 - Create a new cluster file removing all the clusters that do not have anchovy or herring.
- Mostly done, need to check changes and ensure that new files have been created properly. Resume at estimateNearshore with a clean environment on 3/29
# 3 - Recalculate the acoustic proportions of anchovy so that they sum up to 1;
# Set the acoustic proportions of sardine and mackerel, and any other CPS to 0.
# 4 - Match clusters to the nearest acoustic sample
Created nasc.nearshore.deep <- proportions from clf.ns.deep ; densities are 
# 5 - Calculate biomass and numerical densities for the deep CPS NASC
# 6 - Add numerical and biomass densities to the respective vectors from the upper water column
# 7 - Compute estimates using the new combined vector of biomass and numerical densities

Question:
cps.nasc is now just NASC.20; applying the new proportions doesn't add back the deep backscatter.
