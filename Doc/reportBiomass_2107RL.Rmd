# Executive Summary {-}

This report provides: 1) a detailed description of the acoustic-trawl method (ATM) used by NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) for direct assessments of the dominant species of coastal pelagic species (CPS; i.e.:  Pacific Sardine _Sardinops sagax_, Northern Anchovy _Engraulis mordax_, Pacific Mackerel _Scomber japonicus_, Jack Mackerel _Trachurus symmetricus_, Pacific Herring _Clupea pallasii_, and Round Herring, _Etrumeus acuminatus_) in the California Current Ecosystem off the west coast of the United States (U.S.) and Mexico (MX); and 2) estimates of the biomasses, distributions, and demographics of those CPS encountered in the survey area between `r survey.start` and `r survey.end` `r survey.year`. 

The core survey region, which was sampled by NOAA ship _`r survey.vessel.long`_ (hereafter, _`r survey.vessel`_), the Mexican research vessel _Dr. Jorge Carranza Fraser_ (hereafter _Carranza_), and three wind-powered uncrewed surface vehicles (Explorer USVs; Saildrone, Inc.), spanned most of the continental shelf between `r survey.landmark.n` and `r survey.landmark.s`. Throughout the core region, _`r survey.vessel`_, _Carranza_, and USVs sampled along transects oriented approximately perpendicular to the coast, from the shallowest navigable depth (~25 m) to either a distance of 35 nmi or to the 1,000 ftm (~1830 m) isobath, whichever is farthest. In the SCB, transects were extended to approximately 75 nmi. Because sampling by _`r survey.vessel`_ and USVs in water shallower than ~15 m was deemed inefficient, unsafe, or both, fishing vessels _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_ were used to estimate the biomass of CPS in the nearshore region of U.S. waters. The vessels sampled along 5 nmi-long transects spaced 5 nmi apart off the mainland coast of the U.S. between `r survey.landmark.n` and San Diego, CA, as well as around Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands in the Southern CA Bight.  

The biomasses, distributions, and demographics for each species and stock are for the survey area and period and therefore may not represent the entire population or stock. No nearshore sampling was conducted off Baja CA, so nearshore biomass estimates are for U.S. waters only.  

The estimated biomass of the northern stock of Northern Anchovy was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t, CV = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$biomass.cv[be.all.summ$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%).

# Introduction {#introduction}  

In the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), multiple coastal pelagic fish species (CPS; i.e.:  Pacific Sardine _Sardinops sagax_, Northern Anchovy _Engraulis mordax_, Jack Mackerel _Trachurus symmetricus_, Pacific Mackerel _Scomber japonicus_, and Pacific Herring _Clupea pallasii_) comprise the bulk of the forage fish assemblage. These populations, which can change by an order of magnitude within a few years, represent important prey for marine mammals, birds, and larger migratory fishes [@Field2001], and are targets of commercial fisheries.   

During summer and fall, the northern stock of Pacific Sardine typically migrates north to feed in the productive coastal upwelling off OR, WA, and Vancouver Island [@Zwolinski2012, and references therein, **Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-distribution)**]. The predominantly piscivorous adult Pacific and Jack Mackerels also migrate north in summer, but go farther offshore to feed [@Zwolinski2014 and references therein]. In the winter and spring, the northern stock of Pacific Sardine typically migrates south  to its spawning grounds, generally off central and southern CA [@Demer2012] and occasionally off OR and WA [@Lo2011]. These migrations vary in extent with population size; fish age and length; and oceanographic conditions [@Zwolinski2012]. For example, the transition zone chlorophyll front [TZCF; @Polovina2001] may delineate the offshore and southern limit of both Pacific Sardine and Pacific Mackerel habitat [e.g., @Demer2012; @Zwolinski2012], and juveniles may have nursery areas in the Southern CA Bight (SCB), downstream of upwelling regions. In contrast, Northern Anchovy spawn predominantly during winter and closer to the coast where seasonal down-welling increases retention of their eggs and larvae [@Bakun1982]. Pacific Herring spawn in intertidal beach areas [@Love1996]. The northern stock of Northern Anchovy is located off WA and OR and the central stock is located off Central and Southern CA. Whether a species migrates or remains in an area depends on its reproductive and feeding behaviors, affinity to certain oceanographic or seabed habitats, and its population size.  

Acoustic-trawl method (ATM) surveys, which combine information collected with echosounders and nets, were introduced to the CCE more than 48 years ago to survey CPS off the west coast of the United States (U.S.) [@Mais1974;@Mais1977;@Smith1978]. Following a two-decade hiatus, the ATM was reintroduced in the CCE in spring 2006 to sample the then abundant Pacific Sardine population [@Cutter2008]. Since then, this sampling effort has continued and expanded through annual or semi-annual surveys [@Zwolinski2014; @Demer2012]. Beginning in 2011, the ATM estimates of Pacific Sardine abundance, age structure, and distribution have been incorporated in the annual assessments of the northern stock [@Hill2017]. Additionally, ATM survey results are applied to estimate the abundances, demographics, and distributions of epipelagic and semi-demersal fishes [e.g., @Swartzman1997;@Williams2013;@Zwolinski2014] and zooplankton [@Hewitt2000].  

This document, and references herein, describes in detail the ATM as presently used by NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) to survey the distributions and abundances of CPS and their oceanographic environments [e.g., @Cutter2008;@Demer2012;@Zwolinski2014]. In general terms, the contemporary ATM combines information from satellite-sensed oceanographic conditions, multifrequency echosounders, probe-sampled oceanographic conditions, pumped samples of fish eggs, and trawl-net catches of juvenile and adult CPS. The survey area is initially defined with consideration to the potential habitat of a priority stock or stock assemblage, e.g., that for the northern stock of Pacific Sardine (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-distribution)**) or the  northern or central stock of Northern Anchovy. The survey area is further expanded to encompass as much of the potential habitat as possible for other CPS present off the West Coast of the U.S. and Baja CA, Mexico, as time permits.  

Along transects in the survey area, multi-frequency split-beam echosounders transmit sound pulses downward beneath the ship and receive echoes from animals and the seabed in the path of the sound waves. Measurements of sound speed and absorption from conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) probes allow accurate compensation of these echoes for propagation losses. The calibrated echo intensities, normalized to the range-dependent observational volume, provide indications of the target type and behavior [e.g., @Demer2009].  

\newpage  

(ref:sardine-distribution) Conceptual spring (shaded region) and summer (hashed region) distributions of potential habitat for the northern stock of Pacific Sardine along the west coasts of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The dashed and dotted lines represent, respectively, the approximate summer and spring positions of the 0.2 mg m^–3^ chlorophyll-a concentration isoline. This isoline appears to oscillate in synchrony with the transition zone chlorophyll front [TZCF, @Polovina2001] and the offshore limit of the northern stock Pacific Sardine potential habitat [@Zwolinski2011]. Mackerels are found within and on the edge of the same oceanographic  habitat [e.g., @Demer2012; @Zwolinski2012]. The TZCF may delineate the offshore and southern limit of both Pacific Sardine and Pacific Mackerel distributions, and juveniles may have nursery areas in the SCB, downstream of upwelling regions.

\newpage  

Echoes from marine organisms are a function of their body composition, shape, and size relative to the sensing-sound wavelength, and their orientation relative to the incident sound waves [@Cutter2009;@Demer2009;@Renfree2009]. Variations in echo intensity across frequencies, known as echo spectra, indicate the taxonomic groups contributing to the echoes. The CPS, with highly reflective swim bladders, create high intensity echoes of sound pulses at all echosounder frequencies [e.g., @Conti2003]. In contrast, krill, with acoustic properties closer to those of the surrounding seawater, produce lower intensity echoes, particularly at lower frequencies [e.g., @Demer2003]. The echo energy attributed to CPS, based on empirical echo spectra [@Demer2012], are apportioned to species using trawl-catch proportions [@Zwolinski2014].  

Animal densities are estimated by dividing the summed intensities attributed to a species by the length-weighted average echo intensity (the mean backscattering cross-section) from animals of that species [e.g., @Demer2012]. Transects with similar densities are grouped into post-sampling strata that mimic the natural patchiness of the target species [e.g., @Zwolinski2014]. An estimate of abundance is obtained by multiplying the average estimated density in the stratum by the stratum area [@Demer2012]. The associated sampling variance is calculated using non-parametric bootstrap of the mean transect densities. The total abundance estimate in the survey area is the sum of abundances in all strata. Similarly, the total variance estimate is the sum of the variance in each stratum.  

The primary objectives of the SWFSC’s ATM surveys are to survey the distributions and abundances of CPS, krill, and their abiotic environments in the CCE. Typically, spring surveys are conducted during 25-40 days-at-sea (DAS) between March and May, and summer surveys are conducted during 50-90 DAS between June and October. In spring, the ATM surveys focus primarily on the northern stock of Pacific Sardine and the central stock of Northern Anchovy. In summer, the ATM surveys also include the northern stock of Northern Anchovy and Pacific Herring. During spring and summer, the biomasses of other CPS (e.g., Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, and Round Herring) present in the survey area are estimated.  

In `r tolower(survey.season)` `r survey.year`, the ATM survey performed in U.S. waters aboard _`r survey.vessel`_ was augmented with coordinated sampling by fishing vessels _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_ to estimate the biomasses of CPS in nearshore regions, where sampling by _`r survey.vessel`_ was not possible or safe. In addition, three wind-powered uncrewed surface vessels (Explorer USVs; Saildrone, Inc.) conducted acoustic sampling along adaptive transects not sampled by _`r survey.vessel`_. Finally, acoustic and trawl sampling was coordinated with the Mexican research vessel _Dr. Jorge Carranza Fraser_ (hereafter, _Carranza_) off Baja CA, MX, between El Rosario and Punta Abreojos.  

Presented here are:  1) a detailed description of the ATM used to survey CPS in the CCE off the west coast of North America; and 2) estimates of the abundances, biomasses, size structures, and distributions of CPS, specifically the northern and southern stocks of Pacific Sardine; the central and northern stocks of Northern Anchovy, Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, Pacific Herring, and Round Herring for the core and nearshore survey regions. Additional details about the survey may be found in the survey report [@Renfree2022].  

This survey was conducted with the approval of the Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores (SRE, Diplomatic note CTC/1312/2021), the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI; Permit: EG0082021), and the Comisión Nacional de Acuacultura y Pesca (CONAPESCA; Permit: PPFE/DGOPA-073/21).

# Methods {#methods}
## Sampling {#methods-data-collection}
### Design {#methods-survey-design}  

The `r tolower(survey.season)` `r survey.year` survey was conducted principally using _`r survey.vessel`_ and _Carranza_. The sampling domain, or core region, between `r survey.landmark.n` and `r survey.landmark.s`, was defined by the conceptual distribution of potential habitat for the northern stock of Pacific Sardine in summer (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-distribution)**), but also encompassed the anticipated distributions of the southern stock of Pacific Sardine and the central and northern stocks of Northern Anchovy off the west coasts of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. It also spanned portions of the Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, Pacific Herring, and Round Herring populations. East to west, the sampling domain extends from the coast to at least the 1,000 ftm (~1830 m) isobath (**Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**). Considering the expected distribution of the target species, the acceptable uncertainty in biomass estimates, and the available ship time (`r survey.das` days at sea, DAS), the principal survey objectives were the estimations of biomasses for the northern and southern stocks of Pacific Sardine and the northern and central stocks of Northern Anchovy in the survey region. Additionally, biomass estimates were sought for Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, Pacific Herring, and Round Herring in the survey region.  

The transects are perpendicular to the coast, extending from the shallowest navigable depth (~25 m) to either a distance of 35 nmi or to the 1,000 ftm isobath, whichever is farthest (**Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**). When CPS are observed within the westernmost 3 nmi of a transect, that transect and the next one to the south are extended in 5-nmi increments until no CPS are observed in the last 3 nmi of the extension.  

To increase the spatial sampling resolution, acoustic sampling was conducted by USVs (SD-1036, SD-1055, and SD-1059) on transects interstitial to _`r survey.vessel`_ transects from Cape Flattery, WA to Crescent City, CA and from Point Arena, CA to Point Conception, CA (yellow lines, **Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**). To ensure sampling of the western most extents of the CPS distributions, USVs (SD-1036 and SD-1059) were also used to sample offshore extensions of _`r survey.vessel`_'s transects in the SCB. 

To estimate the abundances and biomasses of CPS close to shore, in shallow water, or both, where _`r survey.vessel`_ and USVs could not efficiently or safely navigate or trawl, acoustic and purse seine sampling was conducted nearshore between Cape Flattery and San Diego using two fishing vessels equipped with echosounders (magenta lines, **Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**). _Lisa Marie_ sampled 5-nmi-long transects spaced 5 nmi apart between Cape Flattery and Bodega Bay. _Long Beach Carnage_ sampled 5-nmi-long transects spaced 5 nmi apart between Bodega Bay and San Diego, and 2.5-nmi-long transects spaced 2.5 nmi apart around Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands in the SCB.  


(ref:survey-plan) Planned compulsory and adaptive transects sampled by _`r survey.vessel`_ and _Carranza_; interstitial and offshore transects sampled by USVs; and nearshore transects sampled by _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_. Isobaths (light gray lines) are 50, 200, 500, and 2,000 m (or approximately 27, 109, 273, and 1,094 ftm, respectively).

##### _`r survey.vessel`_  

Multi-frequency Wide-Bandwidth Transceivers (18-, 38-, 70-, 120-, 200-, and 333-kHz Simrad EK80 WBTs; Kongsberg) were configured with split-beam transducers (Simrad `r echo.models`, respectively; Kongsberg). The transducers were mounted on the bottom of a retractable keel or "centerboard" (**Fig. \@ref(fig:cb-config)**). The keel was retracted (transducers at ~`r cb.retracted`-m depth) during calibration, and extended to the intermediate position (transducers at ~`r cb.intermediate`-m depth) during the survey. Exceptions were made during shallow water operations, when the keel was retracted; or during times of heavy weather, when the keel was extended (transducers at ~`r cb.extended`-m depth) to provide extra stability and reduce the effect of weather-generated noise. In addition, acoustic data were also collected using a multibeam echosounder (Simrad ME70; Kongsberg), multibeam sonar (Simrad MS70; Kongsberg), scanning sonar (Simrad SX90; Kongsberg), acoustic Doppler current profiler and echosounder (Simrad EC150-3C, Kongsberg), and a separate ADCP (Ocean Surveyor OS75; Teledyne RD Instruments). Transducer position and motion were measured at 5 Hz using an inertial motion unit (Applanix POS-MV; Trimble).  

##### _Carranza_  

Multi-frequency General Purpose Transceivers (18-, 38-, 70-, 120-, and 200-kHz Simrad EK60 GPTs; Kongsberg) were configured with split-beam transducers (Simrad ES18, ES38B, ES70-7C, ES120-7C, and ES200-7C; Kongsberg) mounted on the bottom of a retractable keel, ~4 m beneath the water surface.  

##### _Lisa Marie_  

The SWFSC's General Purpose Transceiver (38-kHz Simrad EK60 GPT; Kongsberg) was connected to the vessel's hull-mounted split-beam transducer (Simrad ES38B; Kongsberg; not shown).  

##### _Long Beach Carnage_

The SWFSC's multi-frequency General Purpose Transceivers (38-, 70-, 120-, and 200-kHz Simrad EK60 GPTs; Kongsberg) were configured with the SWFSC's split-beam transducers (Simrad ES38-12, ES70-7C, ES120-7C and ES200-7C; Kongsberg) mounted in a multi-frequency transducer array (MTA4) on the bottom of a pole (**Fig. \@ref(fig:cb-config-lbc)**).  

##### USVs  

On the three USVs (SD-1036, SD-1055, and SD-1059), miniature Wide-Bandwidth Transceivers (Simrad WBT-Mini; Kongsberg) were configured with gimbaled, keel-mounted, dual-frequency transducers (Simrad ES38-18|200-18C; Kongsberg) containing a split-beam 38-kHz transducer and single-beam 200-kHz transducer with nominally 18$^\circ$ beamwidths.  

(ref:cb-config) Echosounder transducers mounted on the bottom of the retractable centerboard on _`r survey.vessel`_. During the survey, the centerboard was extended, typically positioning the transducers ~2 m below the keel at a water depth of ~7 m.

#### Echosounder calibrations {#methods-echosounder-calibration}  
##### _`r survey.vessel`_  

The echosounder systems aboard _`r survey.vessel`_ were calibrated on `r cal.datetime` while the vessel was docked at `r cal.loc` (`r cal.lat.dd` $^{\circ}\textrm{N}$, `r cal.lon.dd` $^{\circ}\textrm{W}$) using the standard sphere technique [@Foote1987; @Demer2015]. Each WBT was calibrated in both CW (i.e., continuous wave or narrowband mode) and FM mode (i.e., frequency modulation or broadband mode). The reference target was a `r cal.sphere`; for FM mode, additional calibrations were conducted for the 120, 200, and 333-kHz echosounders using a 25-mm WC sphere (WC25). Prior to the calibrations, temperature and salinity were measured to a depth of 10 m using a handheld probe (Pro2030, YSI) to estimate sound speeds at the transducer and sphere depths, and the time-averaged sound speed and absorption coefficients for the range between them. The theoretical target strength ($TS$; dB re 1 m^2^) of the sphere was calculated using values for the sphere, sound-pulse, and seawater properties. The sphere was positioned throughout the main lobe of each of the transducer beams using three motorized downriggers, two on one side of the vessel and one on the other. The WBTs were configured using the calibration results via the control software (Simrad EK80 `r ek80.version`; Kongsberg; **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results)**). Calibration results for WBTs in FM mode are presented in the survey report [@Renfree2022].  

(ref:cal-results) Wide-Bandwidth Transceiver (Simrad EK80 WBT; Kongsberg) information, pre-calibration settings, and post-calibration beam model results (below the horizontal line). Prior to the survey, on-axis gain ($G_0$), beam angles, angle offsets, and $S_A$ Correction ($S_\mathrm{A}\mathrm{corr}$) values from calibration results were entered into the WBT control software (Simrad EK80; Kongsberg).

\newpage  

##### _Carranza_  

The 18, 38, and 70-kHz GPTs aboard _Carranza_ were calibrated on 29 and 30 January, 2022, using either a 63-mm-diameter copper (Cu63) or a WC38.1 standard sphere, depending on the frequency. Calibrations were unsuccessful for the 120 and 200-kHz GPTs, and therefore results from the most recent calibration, conducted in September 2020, were used. Beam model results (**Table \@ref(tab:cal-results-jcf)**) were entered into the EK80 software.  

(ref:cal-results-jcf) General Purpose Transceiver (Simrad EK60 GPT; Kongsberg) beam model results estimated from calibrations of the echosounders aboard _Carranza_ using either a Cu63 (for 18 kHz) or WC38.1 (for 38, 70, 120, and 200 kHz). Results for the 120 and 200-kHz GPTs are from a calibration conducted in September 2020. Prior to the survey, calibrated on-axis gain ($G_0$), beam angles, angle offsets, and $S_a$ Correction ($S_\mathrm{a}\mathrm{corr}$) values were entered into the GPT-control software (Simrad EK80; Kongsberg).

##### _Lisa Marie_  

The 38-kHz GPT aboard _Lisa Marie_ was calibrated on 5 June 2021 using a WC38.1 standard sphere while the vessel was anchored in Yaquina Bay near Newport, OR (44.6249, -124.0370). Calibration results for _Lisa Marie_ are presented in **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results-lm)**.

##### _Long Beach Carnage_

The 38, 70, 120, and 200 kHz EK60 GPTs aboard _Long Beach Carnage_ were calibrated using a WC38.1 standard sphere, on 13 October 2021, in a tank at the SWFSC [@Demer2015]. Calibration results for _Long Beach Carnage_ are presented in **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results-lbc)**.  

(ref:cal-results-lbc) General Purpose Transceiver (Simrad EK60 GPT; Kongsberg) beam model results estimated from a tank calibration of echosounders aboard _Long Beach Carnage_ using a WC38.1. Prior to the survey, calibrated on-axis gain ($G_0$), beam angles, angle offsets, and $S_a$ Correction ($S_\mathrm{a}\mathrm{corr}$) values were entered into the GPT-control software (Simrad EK80, Kongsberg).

##### USVs  

For three USVs, the echosounders were calibrated by Saildrone, Inc. while dockside in Alameda, CA, using a WC38.1 standard sphere. The data were processed by the SWFSC [@Renfree2019], and the results are presented in **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results-sd)**.

#### Data collection {#methods-acoustic-data-collection}  
\
During daytime aboard _`r survey.vessel`_, measurements of volume backscattering strength ($S_V$; dB re 1 m^2^ m^-3^) and $TS$ (dB re 1 m^2^), indexed by time and geographic positions provided by GPS receivers, were logged to 60 m beyond the detected seabed range or to a maximum of `r raw.log.range` m, and stored in Simrad format (i.e., .raw) with a `r raw.size`-GB maximum file size. During daytime, the echosounders were set to operate in CW mode to remain consistent with echo integration methods used during prior surveys and to reduce data volume. At nighttime, echosounders were set to FM mode to improve target strength estimation and species differentiation for CPS near the surface, and logged to 100 m to reduce data volume. For each acoustic instrument, the prefix for the file names is a concatenation of the survey name (e.g.,  `r survey.name`), the operational mode (CW or FM), and the logging commencement date and time from the EK80 software. For example, file generated by the EK80 software (`r ek80.version`) for a WBT operated in CW mode is named `2107RL-CW-D20210801-T125901.raw`.  

To minimize acoustic interference, transmit pulses from the EK80, ME70, MS70, SX90, EC150-3C, and ADCP were triggered using a synchronization system (Simrad K-Sync; Kongsberg). The K-Sync trigger rate, and thus echosounder ping interval, was modulated by the EAL [@Renfree2016] using the seabed depth measured using the 18-kHz echosounder. During daytime, the ME70, MS70, SX90, and ADCP were operated continuously, but only recorded at the discretion of the acoustician during times when CPS were present. At nighttime, only the EK80 and ADCP were operated. All other instruments that produce sound within the echosounder bandwidths were secured during daytime survey operations. Exceptions were made during stations (e.g., plankton sampling and fish trawling) or in shallow water when the vessel's command occasionally operated the bridge's 50- and 200-kHz echosounders (Furuno), the Doppler velocity log (SRD-500A; Sperry Marine), or both. Data from the ME70, MS70, and SX90 are not presented in this report.  

On _Carranza_, the EK60 echosounders were triggered using a synchronization system (Simrad K-Sync). During daytime acoustic transects, no other acoustic sounders were operated. The ping interval and recording range were modulated based on the seabed depth, respectively: 0.25 s and 100 m for a depth of 0-50 m; 0.5 s and 150 m for a depth of 50-100 m; 0.75 s and 200 m for a depth of 100-150 m; 1 s and 300 m for a depth of 150-200 m; and 2 s and 500 m for a depth of 250-500 m.

On _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_, the EAL was used to control the EK80 software to modulate the echosounder recording ranges and ping intervals to avoid aliased seabed echoes. When the EAL was not utilized, the EK80 software recorded to 200 and 500 m, respectively, and used the maximum ping rate. Transmit pulses from the EK60s and fishing sonars were not synchronized. Therefore, the latter was secured during daytime acoustic transects.

On the USVs, the echosounders were programmed to transmit CW pulses to a range dependent on the transect depth. For deeper seabed depths, the ping interval was 2 s and the 38 and 200-kHz echosounders recorded to 1000 and 400 m, respectively. For shallower depths, the ping interval was 1 s and both echosounders recorded to 250 m. Once an hour, the echosounders would operate in passive mode and record three pings to obtain estimates of the background noise level.  

### Oceanographic {#methods-oceanographic-sampling}
#### Conductivity and temperature versus depth (CTD) {#methods-ctd-sampling}
\
Conductivity and temperature were measured versus depth to `r ctd.depth` m (or to within ~10 m of the seabed when less than `r ctd.depth` m) with calibrated sensors on a CTD rosette (Model SBE911+, Seabird) or underway probe [UnderwayCTD (UCTD); Oceanscience] cast from the vessel. At least one cast was planned along each acoustic transect. These data were used to calculate the harmonic mean sound speed [@Demer2015] for estimating ranges to the sound scatterers, and frequency-specific sound absorption coefficients for compensating signal attenuation of the sound pulse between the transducer and scatterers [@Simmonds2005] (see **Section \@ref(methods-sound-calcs)**).  

#### Scientific Computer System {#methods-scs-sampling}  
\
While underway, information about the position and direction (e.g., latitude, longitude, speed, course over ground, and heading), weather (air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and barometric pressure), and sea-surface oceanography (e.g., temperature, salinity, and fluorescence) were measured continuously and logged using _`r survey.vessel`_'s Scientific Computer System (SCS). During and after the survey, data from a subset of these sensors, logged with a standardized format at 1-min resolution, are available on the internet via NOAA's ERDDAP data server^[https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html].  

###  Fish-eggs {#methods-cufes-sampling}  
On _`r survey.vessel`_ and _Carranza_, fish eggs were sampled during the day using a continuous underway fish egg sampler [CUFES, @Checkley1997], which collects water and plankton at a rate of ~640 l min^-1^ from an intake at ~3-m depth on the hull of the ship. The particles in the sampled water were sieved by a 505-$\mu$m mesh. Pacific Sardine, Northern Anchovy, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Hake (_Merluccius productus_) eggs were identified to species, counted, and logged. Eggs from other species (e.g., Pacific Mackerel and flatfishes) were also counted and logged as "other fish eggs." Typically, the duration of each CUFES sample was 30 min, corresponding to a distance of 5 nmi at a speed of 10 kn for _`r survey.vessel`_, and 4 nmi at a speed of 8 kn for _Carranza_. Because the durations of the early egg stages are short for most fish species, the egg distributions inferred from CUFES indicated the nearby presence of actively spawning fish, and were used in combination with CPS echoes to select trawl locations.  

### Species and Demographics {#methods-trawl-sampling}  

After sunset, CPS schools tend to ascend and disperse and are less likely to avoid a net [@Mais1977]. Therefore, trawling was conducted during the night to better sample the fish aggregations dispersed near the surface to obtain information about species composition, lengths, and weights.  

#### Trawl gear {#methods-trawl-gear}  
##### _`r survey.vessel`_

A Nordic 264 rope trawl (NET Systems, Bainbridge Island, WA; **Fig. \@ref(fig:trawl-diagram)a,b**), was towed at the surface for 45 min at a speed of 3.5-4.5 kn. The net has a rectangular opening with an area of approximately 300 m^2^ (~15-m tall x 20-m wide), a throat with variable-sized mesh and a "marine mammal excluder device" to prevent the capture of large animals, such as dolphins, turtles, or sharks while retaining target species [@Dotson2010], and an 8-mm square-mesh cod-end liner (to retain a large range of animal sizes). The trawl doors were foam-filled and the trawl headrope was lined with floats so the trawl towed at the surface. Temperature-depth recorders (TDRs; RBRduet^3^ T.D., RBR) were attached to the kite and footrope to evaluate trawl performance (**Fig. \@ref(fig:tdr-example)**).  

##### _Carranza_ 

A midwater Mesh Wing Trawl 25/25 (252MWT04i; NET Systems; **Figs. \@ref(fig:trawl-diagram-carranza)**) with equal top and bottom footrope lengths of 48.17 m, was towed for 45 minutes at 3.5 to 4 kn. The mesh size decreases from 1600 to 50 mm, and is constructed of multifilament nylon cloth and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene [@Carranza2021]. The cod-end is a 17-mm Raschel nylon cloth netting.

#### Sampling locations {#methods-trawl-locations}  
##### _`r survey.vessel`_ {#methods-trawl-locations-lasker} 

Up to three nighttime (i.e., 30 min after sunset to 30 min before sunrise) surface trawls, typically spaced at least 10-nmi apart, were conducted in areas where echoes from putative CPS schools were observed earlier that day. Trawl locations were selected using one or more of the following criteria, in descending priority: CPS schools in echograms that day; CPS eggs in CUFES that day; and the trawl locations and catches during the previous night. Each evening, trawl locations were selected by an acoustician who monitored CPS echoes and a biologist who measured the densities of CPS eggs in the CUFES. The locations were provided to the watch Officers who charted the proposed trawl sites.  

If no CPS echoes or CPS eggs were observed along a transect that day, the trawls were alternatively placed nearshore one night and offshore the next night, with consideration given to the seabed depth and the modeled distribution of CPS habitat. Each morning, after the last trawl or 30 min prior to sunrise, _`r survey.vessel`_ resumed sampling at the location where the acoustic sampling stopped the previous day.  

##### _Carranza_ {#methods-trawl-locations-carranza}

Up to three trawls were conducted each night following the same methods as described in **Section \@ref(methods-trawl-locations-lasker)**, for _`r survey.vessel`_.  

#### Sample processing {#methods-trawl-processing}  
##### _`r survey.vessel`_

If the total volume of the trawl catch was five 35-l baskets (~175 l) or less, all target species were separated from the catch, sorted by species, weighed, and enumerated. If the volume of the entire catch was more than five baskets, a five-basket random subsample that included non-target species was collected, sorted by species, weighed, and enumerated; the remainder of the total catch was weighed. In these cases, the weight of the entire catch was calculated as the sum of the subsample and remainder weights. The weight of the $e$-th species in the total catch ($C_{T,e}$) was obtained by summing the catch weight of the respective species in the subsample ($C_{S,e}$) and the corresponding catch in the remainder ($C_{R,e}$), which was calculated as:  

\begin{equation}
C_{R,e} = C_R*P_{w,e}\text{,}
(\#eq:remainder-catch-weight)
\end{equation}

where $P_{w,e} = C_{S,e}/\sum_1^sC_{S,e}$, is the proportion in weight of the $e$-th species in the subsample. The number of specimens of the $e$-th species in the total catch ($N_{T,e}$) was estimated by:  

\begin{equation}
N_{T,e} = \frac{C_{T,e}}{\overline{w}_e}\text{,}
(\#eq:number-specimens-catch)
\end{equation}

where $\overline{w}_e$ is the mean weight of the $e$-th species in the subsample. For Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy with 75 specimens or less, individual measurements of standard length ($L_S$) in mm and weight ($w$) in g were recorded. For Jack Mackerel, Pacific Mackerel, and Pacific Herring with 50 specimens or less, individual measurements of fork length ($L_F$) and $w$ were recorded. In addition, sex and maturity were recorded for up to 75 Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy and up to 25 Jack and Pacific Mackerel. Ovaries were preserved for up to 10 specimens of each CPS species except Pacific Herring. Fin clips were removed from 50 Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy specimens from seven geographic zones (with boundaries at the Columbia River, Cape Mendocino, San Francisco Bay, Point Conception, San Diego, and San Quentin, Baja CA) and preserved in ethanol for genetic analysis. Otoliths were removed from all 50 Pacific Sardine in the subsample; for other CPS species except Pacific Herring, 25 otoliths were removed as equally as possible from the range of sizes present. The combined catches in up to three trawls per night (i.e., trawl cluster) were used to estimate the proportions of species contributing to the nearest samples of acoustic backscatter.  

##### _Carranza_

A sample volume of approximately 15 kg was obtained from each haul. When the biological sample of the target species was less than this volume, the entire sample was processed. Subsequently, the CPS were identified and processed, first by measuring the $L_S$ of each individual in the sample. Then, a proportion of each size interval was obtained with respect to the total number of organisms analyzed, to obtain a subsample for biological sampling that reflects the size distribution observed in the overall sample. The subsample was then processed to obtain specimen length, weight, sex, sexual maturity, fat content, stomach content, and gonadal weight. Otoliths were extracted for future age analysis.  

#### Quality Assurance and Quality Control {#methods-trawl-qaqc}  

At sea, trawl data were entered into a database (Microsoft Access). During and following the survey, data were further scrutinized and verified, or corrected. Missing length ($L_{miss}$) and weight ($W_{miss}$) measurements were estimated as $W_{miss} = \beta_0{L}^{\beta_1}$ and $L_{miss} = (W/\beta_0)^{(1/\beta_1)}$, respectively, where values for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are species- and season-specific parameters of the length-versus-weight relationships described in Palance et al. [@Palance2019]. To identify measurement or data-entry errors, length and weight data were graphically compared (**Fig.** \@ref(fig:lw-plot)) to measurements from previous surveys and models of season-specific length-versus-weight from previous surveys [@Palance2019]. Outliers were flagged, reviewed by the trawl team, and mitigated. Catch data were removed from aborted
trawl hauls, or hauls otherwise deemed unacceptable. Trawl data from _Carranza_ were checked for errors after the survey was completed.

### Purse-seine {#methods-seine-sampling}

Purse seine nets were set to provide information about size, age, and species composition of fishes observed in the echosounders mounted on the fishing vessels that sampled the nearshore region. _Lisa Marie_ used an approximately 440-m-long and 40-m-deep net with 17-mm-wide mesh (A. Blair, pers. comm.). _Long Beach Carnage_ used an approximately 200-m-long and 27-m-deep net with 17-mm-wide mesh; a small section on the back end of the net had 25-mm-wide mesh (R. Ashley, pers. comm.). Specimens collected by _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_ were processed by the WA Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) and CA Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), respectively.

On _Lisa Marie_, as many as three purse seine sets were planned each day. For each set, three dip net samples, spatially separated as much as possible, were collected. For each dip net sample, all specimens were sorted, weighed, and counted to provide a combined weight and count for each. Next, all three dip net samples were combined and up to 50 specimens of each CPS species were randomly sampled to provide a combined weight for each set. Length (mm), $L_S$ for Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy and $L_F$ for all others, and weight (g) were measured for up to 50 randomly selected specimens of each species. Otoliths were extracted, macroscopic maturity stage was determined visually, and gonads were collected and preserved from female specimens.

On _Long Beach Carnage_, as many as three purse seine sets were conducted each day, including evenings. The total weight (tons) of the school was estimated by the captain. For each set, three dip net samples, spatially separated as much as possible, were collected. For each dip net sample, all specimens were sorted, weighed, and counted to provide a combined weight and count for each, and as many as 20 fish of each CPS species were chosen randomly throughout the sample, and combined for a random sample of 50 fish collected throughout the catch. The fish were then frozen for later analysis by CDFW biologists, yielding measures of individual fish and total sample weights (g); length (mm), $L_S$ for Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy and $L_F$ for all others;  maturity; and otolith-derived ages. No female gonad samples were analyzed.

## Data processing {#methods-data-processing}  
### Acoustic and oceanographic data {#methods-acoustic-processing}  

The calibrated echosounder data from each transect were processed using commercial software ([Echoview](https://www.echoview.com/) `r ev.version`; Echoview Software Pty Ltd.) and estimates of the sound speed and absorption coefficient calculated with contemporaneous data from CTD probes cast while stationary or underway (UCTD, see **Section \@ref(methods-ctd-sampling)**). Data collected along the daytime transects at speeds $\geq$ 5 kn were used to estimate CPS densities. Nighttime acoustic data were assumed to be negatively biased due to diel-vertical migration and disaggregation of the target species’ schools [@Cutter2008].  

### Sound speed and absorption calculation {#methods-sound-calcs}  

Depth derived from pressure in CTD casts was used to average samples in 1-m depth bins. Sound speed in each bin ($c_{w,i}$, m s^-1^) was estimated from the average salinity, density, and pH [if measured, else pH = 8; @Chen1977; @Seabird2013]. The harmonic sound speed in the water column ($\overline{c}_w$, m s^-1^) was calculated over the upper 70 m as:  

\begin{equation}
\overline{c}_w = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \Delta r_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \Delta r_i/c_{w,i}}\text{,}
(\#eq:time-avg-sound-speed)
\end{equation}

where $\Delta r$ is the depth of increment $i$ [@Seabird2013]. Measurements of seawater temperature ($t_w$, $^{\circ}\textrm{C}$), salinity ($s_w$, psu), depth, pH, and $\overline{c}_w$ are also used to calculate the mean species-specific absorption coefficients ($\overline{\alpha}_a$, dB m^-1^) over the entire profile using equations in Francois and Garrison [-@Francois1982a], Ainslie and McColm [-@Ainslie1998], and Doonan et al. [-@Doonan2003]. Both $\overline{c}_w$ and $\overline{\alpha}_a$ are later used to estimate ranges to the sound scatterers to compensate the echo signal for spherical spreading and attenuation during propagation of the sound pulse from the transducer to the scatterer range and back [@Simmonds2005]. The CTD rosette, when cast, also provides measures of fluorescence and dissolved oxygen concentration versus depth, which may be used to estimate the vertical dimension of Pacific Sardine potential habitat [@Zwolinski2011], particularly the depth of the upper-mixed layer where most epipelagic CPS reside. The latter information is used to inform echo classification (see **Section \@ref(methods-echo-classification)**).  

### Echo classification {#methods-echo-classification}  

Echoes from schooling CPS and plankton (**Figs. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)a, d**) were identified using a semi-automated data processing algorithm implemented using Echoview software (`r ev.version`; Echoview Software Pty Ltd). The filters and thresholds were based on a subsample of echoes from randomly selected CPS schools. The aim of the filter criteria is to retain at least 95% of the noise-free backscatter from CPS while rejecting at least 95% of the non-CPS backscatter (**Fig. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)**). Data from _`r survey.vessel`_, _Carranza_, and _Long Beach Carnage_ were processed using the following steps:  

1. Match geometry of all $S_v$ variables to the 38-kHz $S_v$;
2. Remove passive-mode pings;
3. Estimate and subtract background noise using the background noise removal function [@DeRobertis2007] in Echoview (**Figs. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)b, e**);
4. Average the noise-free $S_v$ echograms using non-overlapping 11-sample by 3-ping bins;
5. Expand the averaged, noise-reduced _S~v~_ echograms with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation;
6. For each pixel, compute: $S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$, $S_{v,\mathrm{120kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$, and $S_{v,\mathrm{70kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$;
7. Create a Boolean echogram for $S_v$ differences in the CPS range: $-13.85 < S_{v,\mathrm{70kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 9.89 \text{ and} -13.5 < S_{v,\mathrm{120kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 9.37 \text{ and} -13.51 < S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 12.53$;
8. Compute the 120- and 200-kHz Variance-to-Mean Ratios [$VMR_{\mathrm{120kHz}}$ and $VMR_{\mathrm{200kHz}}$, respectively, @Demer2009a] using the difference between noise-filtered $S_v$ (Step 3) and averaged $S_v$ (Step 4);
9. Expand the $VMR_{\mathrm{120kHz}}$ and $VMR_{\mathrm{200kHz}}$ echograms with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation;
10. Create a Boolean echogram based on the $VMR$s in the CPS range: $VMR_{\mathrm{120kHz}}$ > -65 dB and $VMR_{\mathrm{200kHz}}$ > -65 dB. Diffuse backscattering layers have low $VMR$ [@Zwolinski2010] whereas fish schools have high $VMR$ [@Demer2009a];
11. Intersect the two Boolean echograms to create an echogram with "TRUE" samples for candidate CPS schools and "FALSE" elsewhere;
12. Mask the noise-reduced echograms using the CPS Boolean echogram (**Figs. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)c, f**);
13. Create an integration-start line `r int.start` m below the transducer (~10 m depth);
14. Create an integration-stop line `r adz.range` m above the estimated seabed [@Demer2009a], or to the maximum logging range (e.g., `r int.stop` m), whichever is shallowest;
15. Set the minimum $S_v$ threshold to -60 dB (corresponding to a density of approximately three 20-cm-long Pacific Sardine per 100 m^3^);
16. Integrate the volume backscattering coefficients ($s_V$, m^2^ m^-3^) attributed to CPS over 5-m depths and averaged over 100-m distances;
17. Output the resulting nautical area scattering coefficients ($s_A$; m^2^ nmi^-2^) and associated information from each transect and frequency to comma-delimited text (.csv) files.  

Data from _Lisa Marie_ were processed using the following steps:  

1. Remove shorter-duration, transient noise (e.g., ship’s asynchronous sonar) using the Impulse Noise Removal operator;
2. Remove longer-duration, transient noise (e.g., wave-hull collisions) using the Transient Noise Removal operator;
3. Compensate attenuated signals (e.g., from air-bubble attenuation) using the Attenuated Signal Removal operator;
4. Average the noise-free 38-kHz $S_v$ echograms using non-overlapping 11-sample by 3-ping bins;
5. Compute the $VMR$ using the difference between noise-filtered $S_v$ (Step 3) and averaged $S_v$ (Step 4);
6. Create a Boolean echogram mask using $VMR$ > -48 dB;
7. Expand the Boolean mask with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation;
8. Performs Steps 12-17 from _`r survey.vessel`_ processing.

Data from the USVs were processed using the following steps:

1. Match geometry of the $S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}$ to the $S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$;
2. Remove passive-mode pings;
3. Perform Steps 3-5 from _`r survey.vessel`_ processing;
4. For each pixel, compute: $S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$;
5. Create a Boolean echogram for $S_v$ differences in the CPS range: $-13.5 < S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 9.37$
6. Perform Steps 8-9 from _`r survey.vessel`_ processing;
7. Create a Boolean echogram mask using $VMR$ > -57 dB;
8. Performs Steps 11-17 from _`r survey.vessel`_ processing.  

When necessary, the start and stop integration lines were manually edited to exclude reverberation due to bubbles, to include the entirety of shallow CPS aggregations, or to exclude seabed echoes.  

### Removal of non-CPS backscatter {#methods-backscatter-removal}  

In addition to echoes from target CPS, echoes may also be present from other pelagic fish species (Pacific Saury, _Cololabis saira_), or semi-demersal fish such as Pacific Hake and rockfishes ($Sebastes$ spp.). When analyzing the acoustic-survey data, it was therefore necessary to filter "acoustic by-catch," i.e., backscatter not from the target species. To exclude echoes from mid-water, demersal, and benthic fishes, echograms were visually examined to exclude fish echoes where the seabed was hard and rugose, or where diffuse schools are observed offshore either near the surface or deeper than ~250 m (**Fig. \@ref(fig:extract-nasc)**). In areas dominated by Pacific Herring, for example off Vancouver Island, backscatter was integrated to a maximum depth of 75 m.  

(ref:ev-filtering-example) Two examples of echograms depicting CPS schools (red) and plankton aggregations (blue and green) at 38 kHz (top) and 120 kHz (bottom). Example data processing steps include the original echogram (a, d), after noise subtraction and bin-averaging (b, e), and after filtering to retain only putative CPS echoes (c, f).

(ref:extract-nasc) Echoes from fishes with swimbladders (blue points, scaled by backscatter intensity) along an example acoustic transect (top) and the corresponding echogram image (bottom). In this example, the upper (blue) and lower lines (green) indicate boundaries within which echoes were retained. When the lower boundary is deeper than the seabed (black line), echoes above the seabed are retained.  Echoes from deep, bottom-dwelling schools of non-CPS fishes with swimbladders, and from diffuse scatterers near the surface were excluded. The proximity of the echoes to the seabed was also used to define the lower limit for vertical integration.

In this example, temperature profiles indicate an ~25 m-deep mixed-layer above an ~20-30 m thermocline, so the 11 $^{\circ}\textrm{C}$ isotherm (bold, blue line; right panel) was used to remove echoes from deeper, bottom-dwelling schools of non-CPS fishes with swimbladders. The proximity of the echoes to the seabed (bold, red line; right panel) was also used to define the lower limit for vertical integration.

### Quality Assurance and Quality Control {#methods-acoustics-qaqc}  

The largest 38-kHz integrated backscattering coefficients ($s_A$, m^2^ nmi^-2^) were graphically examined to identify potential errors in the integrated data from Echoview processing (e.g.,  when a portion of the seabed was accidentally integrated, not shown). If found, errors were corrected and data were re-integrated prior to use for biomass estimation.  

### Echo integral partitioning and acoustic inversion {#methods-echointegration}  

For fishes with swimbladders, the acoustic backscattering cross-section of an individual ($\sigma_{bs}$, m^2^) depends on many factors but mostly on the acoustic wavelength and the swimbladder size and orientation relative to the incident sound pulse. For echosounder sampling conducted in this survey, $\sigma_{bs}$ is a function of the dorsal-surface area of the swimbladder and was approximated by a function of fish length, i.e.:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{bs} = 10^{\frac{m\,\log_{10}(L)+b}{10}}\text{,}
(\#eq:sigma-bs)
\end{equation}

where $m$ and $b$ are frequency and species-specific parameters that are obtained theoretically or experimentally (see references below). $TS$, a logarithmic representation of $\sigma_{bs}$, is defined as:

\begin{equation}
TS = 10\,\log_{10}(\sigma_{bs}) = m\,\log_{10}(L) + b\text{.}
(\#eq:ts-sigma-bs-equation)
\end{equation}

$TS$ has units of dB re 1 m^2^ if defined for an individual, or dB re 1 m^2^ kg^-1^ if defined by weight. The following equations for $TS_{38\mathrm{kHz}}$, were used in this analysis:  

\begin{equation}
TS_{\mathrm{38kHz}} = -14.90 \times \log_{10} (L_T) - 13.21 \text{, for Pacific Sardine;}
(\#eq:tl-ts-sardine)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
TS_{\mathrm{38kHz}} = -11.97 \times \log_{10} (L_T) - 11.58561 \text{, for Pacific and Round Herrings;}
(\#eq:tl-ts-herring)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
TS_{\mathrm{38kHz}} = -13.87 \times \log_{10} (L_T) - 11.797 \text{, for Northern Anchovy; and}
(\#eq:tl-ts-anchovy)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
TS_{\mathrm{38kHz}} = -15.44 \times \log_{10} (L_T) - 7.75 \text{, for Pacific and Jack Mackerels,}
(\#eq:tl-ts-mackerel)
\end{equation}

where the units for total length ($L_T$) is cm and $TS$ is dB re 1 m^2^ kg^-1^.  

Equations \@ref(eq:tl-ts-sardine) and \@ref(eq:tl-ts-mackerel) were derived from echosounder measurements of $\sigma_{bs}$ for in situ fish and measures of $L_T$ and $W$ from concomitant catches of South American Pilchard (_Sardinops ocellatus_) and Horse Mackerel (_Trachurus trachurus_) off South Africa [@Barange1996]. Because mackerels have similar $TS$ [@Pena2008], Equation \@ref(eq:tl-ts-mackerel) is used for both Pacific and Jack Mackerels. For Pacific Herring and Round Herring, Equation \@ref(eq:tl-ts-herring) was derived from that of Thomas et al. [-@Thomas2002] measured at 120 kHz with the following modifications: 1) the intercept used here was calculated as the average intercept of Thomas et al.'s spring and fall regressions; 2) the intercept was compensated for swimbladder compression after Zhao et al. [-@Zhao2008] using the average depth for Pacific Herring of 44 m; 3) the intercept was increased by 2.98 dB to account for the change of frequency from 120 to 38 kHz [@Saunders2012]. For Northern Anchovy, Equation \@ref(eq:tl-ts-anchovy) was derived from that of Kang et al. [-@Kang2009], after compensation of the swimbladder volume [@Ona2003;@Zhao2008] for the average depth of Northern Anchovy observed in summer 2016 [19 m, @Zwolinski2017].  

To calculate $TS_{38\mathrm{kHz}}$, $L_T$ was estimated from measurements of $L_S$ or $L_F$ using linear relationships between length and weight derived from specimens collected in the CCE [@Palance2019]: for Pacific Sardine, $L_T = 0.3574 + 1.149L_S$; for Northern Anchovy, $L_T = 0.2056 + 1.1646 L_S$; for Pacific Mackerel, $L_T = 0.2994 + 1.092 L_F$; for Jack Mackerel $L_T = 0.7295 + 1.078 L_F$; and for Pacific Herring $L_T = -0.105 + 1.2 L_F$. Since a conversion does not exist for Round Herring, the equation for Pacific Herring was used to estimate $L_T$.  

The proportions of species in a trawl cluster were considered representative of the proportions of species in the vicinity of the cluster. Therefore, the proportion of the echo-integral from the $e$-th species ($P_e$) in an ensemble of $s$ species can be calculated from the species catches $N_1, N_2,..., N_s$ and the respective average backscattering cross-sections $\sigma_{bs_1}, \sigma_{bs_2},...,\sigma_{bs_s}$ [@Nakken1975]. The acoustic proportion for the $e$-th species in the $a$-th trawl ($P_{ae}$) is:

\begin{equation}
P_{ae} = \frac{N_{ae} \times \overline{w}_{ae} \times \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae}}{\sum_{e=1}^{s_a} (N_{ae} \times \overline{w}_{ae} \times \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae})}\text{, }
(\#eq:acoustic-prop-spp)
\end{equation}

where $\overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae}$ is the arithmetic counterpart of the average target strength ($\overline{TS}_{ae}$) for all $n_{ae}$ individuals of species $e$ in the random sample of trawl $a$:  

\begin{equation}
\overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n_{ae}}10^{(TS_i/10)}}{n_{ae}}\text{, }
(\#eq:avg-ts-all-spp)
\end{equation}

and $\overline{w}_{ae}$ is the average weight: $\overline{w}_{ae} = \sum_{i=1}^{n_{ae}}{w_{aei}}/{n_{ae}}$. The total number of individuals of species $e$ in a trawl $a$ ($N_{ae}$) is obtained by: $N_{ae}=\frac{n_{ae}}{w_{s,ae}} \times w_{t,ae}$, where $w_{s,ae}$ is the weight of the $n_{ae}$ individuals sampled randomly, and $w_{t,ae}$ is the total weight of the respective species' catch.  

The trawls within a cluster were combined to reduce sampling variability (see **Section \@ref(methods-trawl-clustering)**), and the number of individuals caught from the $e$-th species in a cluster $g$ ($N_{ge}$) was obtained by summing the catches across the $h$ trawls in the cluster: $N_{ge}=\sum_{a=1}^{h_g}N_{ae}$.  The backscattering cross-section for species $e$ in the $g$-th cluster with $a$ trawls is then given by:  

\begin{equation}
\overline{\sigma}_{bs,ge}=\frac{\sum_{a=1}^{h_g} N_{ae} \times \overline{w}_{ae} \times \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae}}{\sum_{a=1}^{s_g} N_{ae} \times \overline{w}_{ae}}\text{, }
(\#eq:sigma-spp-j)
\end{equation}

where:  

\begin{equation}
\overline{w}_{ge} = \frac{\sum_{a=1}^{h_g} N_{ae} \times \overline{w}_{ae}}{\sum_{a=1}^{h_g} N_{ae}}\text{, }
(\#eq:w-spp-j)
\end{equation}

and the proportion ($P_{ge}$) is;

\begin{equation}
P_{ge} = \frac{N_{ge} \times \overline{w}_{ge} \times \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae}}{\sum_{e=1}^{s}(N_{ge} \times \overline{w}_{ge} \times \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ge})}\text{.}
(\#eq:prop-spp-j)
\end{equation}  

### Trawl clustering and species proportion {#methods-trawl-clustering}  

Trawls that occurred on the same night were assigned to a trawl cluster. Biomass densities ($\rho$) were calculated for 100-m transect intervals by dividing the integrated area-backscatter coefficients for each CPS species by the mean backscattering cross-sectional area [@MacLennan2002] estimated in the trawl cluster nearest in space. Survey data were post-stratified to account for spatial heterogeneity in sampling effort and biomass density in a similar way to that performed for Pacific Sardine [@Zwolinski2016].  

For a generic 100-m long acoustic interval, the area-backscattering coefficient for species $e$: $s_{A,e} = s_{A,cps} \times P_{ge}$, where $P_{ge}$ is the species acoustic proportion of the nearest trawl cluster (Equation \@ref(eq:prop-spp-j)), was used to estimate the biomass density ($\rho_{w,e}$) [@MacLennan2002; @Simmonds2005] for every 100-m interval, using the size and species composition of the nearest (space and time) trawl cluster (**Fig. \@ref(fig:trawl-cluster-map)**):

\begin{equation}
\rho_{w,e} = \frac{s_{A,e}}{4\pi\overline{\sigma}_{bs,e}}\text{.}
(\#eq:biomass-density)
\end{equation}  

The biomass densities were converted to numerical densities using: $\rho_{n,e}=\rho_{w,e}/\overline{w}_e$, where $\overline{w}_e$ is the corresponding mean weight. Also, for each acoustic interval, the biomass or numeric densities are partitioned into length classes according to the species' length distribution in the respective trawl cluster.  

## Data analysis {#methods-data-analysis}
### Post-stratification {#methods-post-stratification}  

The transects were sampling units [@Simmonds1996]. Because each species does not generally span the entire survey area [@Zwolinski2014; @Demer2017], the sampling domain was stratified for each species and stock. Strata were defined by uniform transect spacing (sampling intensity) and either presences (positive densities and potentially structural zeros) or absences (real zeros) of species biomass. Each stratum has: 1) at least three transects, with approximately equal spacing, 2) fewer than three consecutive transects with zero-biomass density, and 3) bounding transects with zero-biomass density (**Fig. \@ref(fig:tx-biom-dens)**). This approach tracks stock patchiness and creates statistically-independent, stationary, post-sampling strata [@Johannesson1983; @Simmonds1992]. For Northern Anchovy, we define the separation between the northern and central stock at Cape Mendocino (`r round(stock.break.anch,1)` $^{\circ}\textrm{N}$). For Pacific Sardine, the northern and southern stocks present in the survey area [@Hill2014; @Felix-Uraga2004; @Felix-Uraga2005; @Garcia-Morales2012] were separated using the Pacific Sardine potential habitat during the survey (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-potential-habitat)**). This separation may be further supported by distributions of $L_S$, a break in the distribution of Pacific Sardine biomass, which, in this survey, coincided geographically with San Francisco (`r round(stock.break.sar,1)` $^{\circ}\textrm{N}$, **Fig. \@ref(fig:tx-biom-dens)**), or both.

### Biomass and sampling precision estimation {#methods-biomass-and-precision}  

For each stratum and stock, the biomass ($\hat{B}$; kg) of each species was estimated by: 

\begin{equation}
\hat{B} = A \times \hat{D}\text{, }
(\#eq:biomass-mean)
\end{equation}

where $A$ is the stratum area (nmi^2^) and $\hat{D}$ is the estimated mean biomass density (kg nmi^-2^):

\begin{equation}
\hat{D} = \frac{\sum_{l=1}^{k}\overline{\rho}_{w,l} c_l}{\sum_{l=1}^{k}c_l}\text{, }
(\#eq:biomass-mean-density)
\end{equation}

where $\overline{\rho}_{w,l}$ is the mean biomass density of the species on transect $l$, $c_l$ is the transect length, and $k$ is the total number of transects. The variance of $\hat{B}$ is a function of the variability of the transect-mean densities and associated lengths. Treating transects as replicate samples of the underlying population [@Simmonds1996], the variance was calculated using bootstrap resampling [@Efron1981] based on transects as sampling units. Provided that each stratum has independent and identically-distributed transect means (i.e., densities on nearby transects are not correlated, and they share the same statistical distribution), bootstrap or other random-sampling estimators provide unbiased estimates of variance.

The 95% confidence intervals (CI~95%~) for the mean biomass densities ($\hat{D}$) were estimated as the 0.025 and 0.975 percentiles of the distribution of `r boot.num` bootstrap survey-mean biomass densities. Coefficient of variation (CV, %) values were obtained by dividing the bootstrapped standard error by the mean estimate [@Efron1981]. Total biomass in the survey area was estimated as the sum of the biomasses in each stratum, and the associated sampling variance was calculated as the sum of the variances across strata.  

### Abundance- and biomass-at-length estimation {#methods-abundance-at-length}  

The numerical densities by length class (**Section \@ref(methods-trawl-clustering)**) were averaged for each stratum in a similar way for that used for biomass (Equation \@ref(eq:biomass-mean-density)), and multiplied by the stratum area to obtain abundance per length class.  

### Percent biomass per cluster contribution {#methods-cluster-biomass-density}  

The percent contribution of each cluster to the estimated abundance in a stratum (**Appendix \@ref(appendix-cluster-length-percent)**) was calculated as:  

\begin{equation}
\frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^{l}\overline{\rho}_{ci}}{\Sigma_{c=1}^{C}\Sigma_{i=1}^{l}\overline{\rho}_{ci}}{\text{,}}
(\#eq:pct-acoustic-biomass)
\end{equation}

where $\overline{\rho}_{ci}$ is the numerical density in interval $i$ represented by the nearest trawl cluster $c$.

In the core survey region that spanned this entire area (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)**), _`r survey.vessel`_ (`r das.rl` days at sea, DAS), _Carranza_ (`r das.jcf` DAS), and the three USVs (`r sum(das.sd$das)` mission days) sampled `r nrow(nasc.summ)` east-west transects totaling `r prettyNum(sum(nasc.summ$distance), digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` nmi.

**Leg I**  

On 6 July, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego, CA at ~1700 (all times UTC). Prior to the transit toward northern Vancouver Island, the EC150-3C was calibrated northwest of the sea buoy outside San Diego Bay (32.6598 N,  117.3833 W). Throughout the transit, sampling was conducted during the day with CUFES, EK80s, ME70, MS70 and SX90. Due to departure delays and weather delays during transit, planned sampling off Vancouver Island was abandoned. On 12 July at ~1930, _`r survey.vessel`_ began acoustic sampling along Transect 140 off Cape Flattery, WA. On 18 July, after sampling most of Transect 116, _`r survey.vessel`_ transited south to Transect 108 and resumed sampling transects from south to north for the remainder of Leg I. On 22 July, acoustic sampling ceased after the completion of Transect 116 off Newport, OR. _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the Marine Operations-Pacific (MOC-P) Pier in Newport, OR at ~1730 to complete Leg I.

During Leg I, _Lisa Marie_ sampled Transects 352 to 291, the nearshore region between Cape Flattery, WA to Coos Bay, OR, from 16 to 22 July. Two USVs (SD-1055 and SD-1059) sampled Transects 139 to 127, between Cape Flattery, WA to the Columbia River, from 11 to 26 July.

**Leg II**  

On 27 July, after a two-day delay, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from the Marine Operations-Pacific (MOC-P) Pier, Newport, OR, at ~1130 and transited south; acoustic sampling  resumed along Transect 106 at ~1300 on 28 July.  An Autonomous Spar Buoy Recorder (DASBR) was deployed for the SWFSC Marine Mammal and Turtle Division on 31 July before starting Transect 099.  After completing Transect 099, _`r survey.vessel`_ transited to Humboldt Bay, CA to embark the Second Cook. On 13 August, acoustic sampling ceased after completion of Transect 057 off Point Estero, CA in Harmony Headlands State Park. On 15 August, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego Bay at ~1700 to complete Leg II.

During Leg II, _Lisa Marie_ sampled Transects 289 to 231, the nearshore region between Coos Bay, OR to Fort Ross, CA, from 28 July to 5 August. _Long Beach Carnage_ sampled Transects 230 to 176, the nearshore region between Fort Ross to Point Conception, CA, from 12 to 21 August. Two USVs (SD-1055 and SD-1059) sampled Transects 125 to 109, between the Columbia River to Coos Bay, OR, from 26 July to 10 August; two USVs (SD-1036 and SD-1055) then sampled Transects 080 to 062, between Point Arena, CA to Big Sur, CA, from 26 August to 6 September.

**Leg III** 

On 8 September, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from the fuel pier at the 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego, CA at ~1315 and began the transit to resume acoustic sampling along Transect 053 at ~1500. On 20 September, acoustic sampling ceased after the completion of Transect 039 off San Diego, CA. On 20 September, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the 10th Avenue Marine Terminal at ~0300 to complete Leg III.

During Leg III, _Long Beach Carnage_ sampled Transects 174 to 138, the nearshore region between Point Conception, CA to the U.S.-Mexico border, and the Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands, from 12 to 19 September. Three USVs (SD-1036, SD-1055, and SD-1059) sampled Transects 060 to 040, between Big Sur and San Diego, from 6 to 24 September. Transects 051 to 040 were offshore extensions of the same transects sampled by _`r survey.vessel`_ in the core region. 

**Leg IV** 

On 25 September, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from the 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego Bay at ~1730. Not yet having a permit to survey off Mexico, _`r survey.vessel`_ transited north toward Cape Blanco, OR to acoustically sample farther offshore on transects where CPS eggs and backscatter were observed previously. On 28 September, _`r survey.vessel`_ sought shelter from rough seas in Drake’s Bay near San Francisco, CA. Prior to dropping anchor, a second calibration of the EC150-3C ADCP was conducted north of the shipping channel (37.8880 N, 122.8870  W). During this time, engineers tended to the thrust bearing on the propeller shaft that began leaking lubricant during the calibration. At ~1500 on 30 September, _`r survey.vessel`_ weighed anchor and continued the transit to Cape Blanco, OR. At ~1400 on 2 October, acoustic sampling resumed along Transect 107. On 4 October, after sampling a portion of Transect 113, the permit to survey off Mexico was received, _`r survey.vessel`_ promptly ceased acoustic sampling and turned south toward Mexico. On 7 October, Keighley Lane was put ashore via _`r survey.vessel`_'s work boat, and then the ship continued toward the survey area off northern Baja CA. At ~1500 on 8 October, acoustic sampling resumed along Transect 031 near Tijuana, MX. On 14 October, acoustic sampling ceased after the completion of transect 018 off Las Flores, MX. On 15 October, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the fuel pier at 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego at ~0630  to complete the survey.

During Leg IV, _Carranza_ sampled Transects 055 to 027, between Las Flores to Punta Abreojos, MX, from 19 October to 8 November. 

## Acoustic backscatter {#results-backscatter-distribution} 

Acoustic backscatter ascribed to CPS was observed throughout the latitudinal range of the core survey area (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)a**). Between approximately Fort Bragg and Pt. Conception, backscatter from CPS was present from near the coast to the shelf break, but was compressed along the coast to the north and south and around the Channel Islands in the SCB. Zero-biomass intervals were observed at the offshore end of each transect in the core region. The majority (greater than `r cum.biomass.limit*100`%) of the biomass for each species was apportioned using catch data from trawl clusters conducted within 30 nmi (**Fig. \@ref(fig:biomass-cluster-distance)**).  

Acoustic backscatter ascribed to CPS was also observed throughout the nearshore survey area (**Figs. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lm)a** and **\@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lbc)a**), but was most prevalent in transects sampled by _Lisa Marie_ between Crescent City and Bodega Bay (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lm)a**) and along transects sampled by _Long Beach Carnage_ between Bodega Bay and San Francisco, between Big Sur and Long Beach, and around Santa Cruz Island (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lbc)a**).  

## Egg densities and distributions {#results-cufes-density}  

Jack Mackerel and Pacific Sardine eggs were predominant in CUFES samples collected north of Monterey Bay, but were most abundant around Cape Blanco and the mouth of the Columbia River (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)b**). Northern Anchovy eggs were predominant in the SCB and near El Rosario off the coast of Baja CA (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)b**). Pacific Sardine eggs were also present in samples collected nearshore by _Carranza_ in Sebastián Vizcaíno Bay and south of Punta Eugenia (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)b**).  

## Trawl catch {#results-trawl-catch}  

Trawl catches from _`r survey.vessel`_ and _Carranza_ were comprised of mostly Jack Mackerel north of Cape Mendocino, and Northern Anchovy to the south (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**). Pacific Herring were present in several trawl clusters off the coast of WA and OR. Pacific Sardine were caught in relatively small numbers offshore of central OR, near Pt. Conception, and along Baja CA south of El Rosario (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**). Pacific Mackerel were caught in the SCB and off Baja CA south of El Rosario (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**). Round Herring were the predominant species in most trawl clusters between El Rosario and Punta Abreojos (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**). Overall, the `r nrow(haul)` trawls captured a combined `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$AllCPS),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of CPS (`r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'Anchovy'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Northern Anchovy, `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'Sardine'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Sardine, `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'PacMack'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Mackerel, `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'JackMack'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Jack Mackerel, `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'PacHerring'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Herring, and `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'RndHerring'),big.mark=",",digits=2)` kg of Round Herring).  

## Purse seine catch {#results-seine-catch}

```{r summarise-seine-catch}
# Summarise Lisa Marie catch
seine.summ.lm <- lm.specimens %>% 
  group_by(scientificName) %>% 
  summarise(
    total.wt = sum(weightg)/1000,
    total.ct = n()

  group_by(scientificName) %>%
  summarise(
    total.wt = sum(weightg)/1000,

  )
```

### _Lisa Marie_  

Pacific Herring were predominant, by weight, in purse seine samples collected by _Lisa Marie_ nearshore off WA, OR, and CA north of Cape Mendocino (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lm)b**). Between Cape Mendocino and Bodega Bay, Northern Anchovy were most abundant (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lm)b**). The purse seine was only deployed when schools were present, so purse seine sampling was sparse along portions of the WA and OR coast (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lm)b**). Overall, the `r nrow(lm.sets)` seines captured a combined `r prettyNum(sum(seine.summ.lm$total.wt),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of CPS (`r prettyNum(seine.summ.lm$total.wt[seine.summ.lm$scientificName == "Engraulis mordax"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Northern Anchovy, `r prettyNum(seine.summ.lm$total.wt[seine.summ.lm$scientificName == "Clupea pallasii"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Herring, and `r prettyNum(seine.summ.lm$total.wt[seine.summ.lm$scientificName == "Sardinops sagax"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Sardine; and no Pacific or Jack Mackerel). 

### _Long Beach Carnage_  

Northern Anchovy were predominant, by weight, in purse seine samples collected by _Long Beach Carnage_ nearshore off central CA between Cape Mendocino and Monterey Bay, and in the SCB between Los Angeles and Long Beach (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lbc)b**). Pacific Sardine were predominant between Big Sur and Pt. Conception; between Long Beach and San Diego; and around Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands  (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lbc)b**). Some Pacific Mackerel were collected between Oceanside, CA and San Diego and around Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands. Jack Mackerel were collected between Big Sur and Morro Bay, and off San Diego (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lbc)b**). Overall, dip net samples from `r nrow(lbc.sets)` seines totaled `r prettyNum(sum(seine.summ.lbc$total.wt),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of CPS (`r prettyNum(seine.summ.lbc$total.wt[seine.summ.lbc$scientificName == "Sardinops sagax"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Sardine, `r prettyNum(seine.summ.lbc$total.wt[seine.summ.lbc$scientificName == "Scomber japonicus"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Mackerel, `r prettyNum(seine.summ.lbc$total.wt[seine.summ.lbc$scientificName == "aaafd symmetricus"],big.mark=",",digits=2)` kg of Jack Mackerel, and `r prettyNum(seine.summ.lbc$total.wt[seine.summ.lbc$scientificName == "Engraulis mordax"],big.mark=",",digits=2)` kg of Northern Anchovy; and no Pacific Herring). 

### Combined catch

In some areas, purse seine sets were sparse (**Figs. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lm)b** and **\@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lbc)b**). To estimate biomass in the nearshore region, acoustic intervals were assigned the species proportions from the nearest purse seine set or trawl `r cluster.source["NS"]` (not trawl cluster), whichever was closest (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-prop-ns)b**).

# Discussion {#discussion}  

The principal objectives of the `r survey.das`-day, summer 2021 CCE Survey were to estimate the biomasses and distributions of the northern and southern stocks of Pacific Sardine and the northern and central stocks of Northern Anchovy. Secondary objectives were to produce estimates for Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, Pacific Herring, and Round Herring within the survey area at the time of the survey. 

Despite inclement weather conditions, mechanical limitations, and logistical challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, _`r survey.vessel`_ surveyed from Cape Flattery to El Rosario off Baja CA, and _Carranza_ extended the survey area from El Rosario to **~10** nmi south of Punta Abreojos.

This is the first time that the SWFSC's ATM sampling was coordinated with INAPESCA's sampling from _Carranza_. This historic collaboration facilitated the sampling of multiple stocks that span the U.S.-Mexico border, and resulted in estimations of the biomasses and distributions of the entire central stock of Northern Anchovy and the entire southern stock of Pacific Sardine. Since no nearshore sampling was conducted off Baja CA, biomass estimates may be negatively biased in that region.   

## Biomass and abundance
### Northern Anchovy {#discussion-anchovy-biomass} 
#### Northern stock {#discussion-anchovy-biomass-northern} 

```{r}
# Summarize percent total biomass for NS anchovy
biomass.pct.anch.n <- biomass.spp.summ %>% 
  filter(species == "Engraulis mordax", stock == "Northern")

The estimated biomass of the northern stock of Northern Anchovy in the survey region north of Cape Mendocino was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all$Stock == "Northern"], big.mark=",", digits = 4)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=4)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=5)` t) in summer 2021. The northern stock biomass has comprised a small fraction (`r round(min(biomass.pct.anch.n$biomass.pct),1)` to `r round(max(biomass.pct.anch.n$biomass.pct),1)`%) of the total biomass in the ATM surveys conducted in the CCE since at least 2015 [@Stierhoff2021a].

The estimated biomass of the central stock of Northern Anchovy in the survey region was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all$Stock == "Central"], big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Central"],big.mark=",",digits=5)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Central"],big.mark=",",digits=5)` t) in summer 2021, and comprised `r round(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all$Stock == "Central"]/sum(be.all.summ$Biomass)*100)`% of the total CPS biomass in summer 2021.

Similar to spring 2021 [@Zwolinski2023b], the boundary between the northern and southern stocks of Pacific Sardine was San Francisco, based foremost on associations with potential habitat but corroborated by the distributions of biomass density north and south of San Francisco Bay, and differences in length distribution (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-stock-allocation)**.

Since 2014, the ATM biomass of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine has remained less than the 150,000 t rebuilding target adopted by the Pacific Fishery Management Council in 2020^[https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2020/08/g-1-attachment-1-pacific-sardine-rebuilding-plan-preliminary-environmental-analysis.pdf/] (**Figs. \@ref(fig:biomass-ts-line)** and **\@ref(fig:biomass-ts-bar)**).

This was `r round(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Clupea pallasii']/biomass.pct.her$biomass[biomass.pct.her$year == 2019]*100,1)`% of the `r prettyNum(biomass.pct.her$biomass[biomass.pct.her$year == 2019],big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t estimated in summer 2019 [@Stierhoff2020b], when the survey also included the west coast of Vancouver Island, Canada [@Stierhoff2020b]. The summer surveys in 2017 and 2018 also included Vancouver Island. However, in summers 2021, 2018 [@Stierhoff2019b], and 2017 [@Zwolinski2019a], the stock was closer to shore and more discontinuously distributed compared to summer 2019 when the stock spanned a greater portion of the continental shelf [@Stierhoff2020b].    

### Round Herring {#discussion-rherring} 

In summer 2021, the estimated biomass of Round Herring in the core survey region was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Etrumeus acuminatus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Etrumeus acuminatus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Etrumeus acuminatus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t), and was observed entirely in the southernmost portion of the survey area surveyed by _`r survey.vessel`_ and _Carranza_, between El Rosario and Punta Abreojos. This was the first time the SWFSC's ATM survey has encountered Round Herring and estimated its biomass.

## Ecosystem dynamics: Forage fish community {#discussion-ecosystem-dynamics}  

The acoustic-trawl method (ATM) has been used to monitor the biomasses and distributions of pelagic and mid-water fish stocks worldwide [e.g., @Coetzee2008; @Karp1994; @Simmonds2009]. In the CCE, ATM surveys have been used to directly assess Pacific Hake [@JTC2014; @Edwards2018], rockfishes [@Starr1996; @Demer2012b; @Demer2012c; @Demer2012d], Pacific Herring [@Thomas2003], and CPS [@Mais1974; @Mais1977; @Hill2017]. In 2006, the SWFSC's ATM survey in the CCE was focused on Pacific Sardine [@Cutter2008], but evolved to assess the five most abundant CPS [@Zwolinski2014]: Pacific Sardine, Northern Anchovy, Jack Mackerel, Pacific Mackerel, and Pacific Herring. The proportions of these stocks that are in water too shallow to be sampled by NOAA ships are estimated using samples collected from fishing vessels and USVs. Also, concurrent satellite- and ship-based measures of their biotic and abiotic habitats are used to provide an ecosystem perspective.  

Collectively, these annual or bi-annual ATM surveys provide a unique insight into the dynamics of forage fishes in the CCE, including their distributions, abundances, interactions, and environments. For example, results from 2006 through 2013 indicate that Pacific Sardine dominated the CPS assemblage, but their biomass was declining [@Demer2012a; @Zwolinski2012a] and their seasonal migration was contracting [@Zwolinski2014]. Meanwhile, harvest rates for the declining stock increased [@Demer2017], and the total forage-fish biomass decreased to less than 200,000 t in 2014 and 2015 (**Figs. \@ref(fig:biomass-ts-line), \@ref(fig:biomass-ts-bar)**). The U.S. fishery for Pacific Sardine was closed in 2015 [@NMFS2015], and there were reports of mass strandings, deaths, and reproductive failures in Brown Pelicans (_Pelecanus occidentalis_^[https://e360.yale.edu/features/brown_pelicans_a_test_case_for_the_endangered_species_act]), Common Murres (_Uria aalge_), Brandt’s Cormorants (_Phalacrocorax penicillatus_), and California sea lions (_Zalophus californianus_^[https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-life-distress/2013-2017-california-sea-lion-unusual-mortality-event-california]) [@McClatchie2016], all of which depend on forage species. Since 2016, the forage-fish biomass has increased, mainly due to resurgences of Jack Mackerel and the now dominant central stock of Northern Anchovy (**Figs. \@ref(fig:biomass-ts-line), \@ref(fig:biomass-ts-bar)**), whose biomass primarily (`r prettyNum(be.anch.c$Biomass[be.anch.c$Stratum == 3],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t, or `r round(be.anch.c$Biomass[be.anch.c$Stratum == 3]/sum(be.anch.c$Biomass)*100)`% of the total estimate biomass) occurred in U.S. waters. Between the summers of 2018 and 2021, the biomass of the southern stock of Pacific Sardine in U.S. waters has increased from 33,093 to `r prettyNum(sum(be.sar.s$Biomass[be.sar.s$Stratum %in% c(3:4)]), big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t.
