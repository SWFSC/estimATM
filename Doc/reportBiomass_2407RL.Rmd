# Executive Summary {-}

This report provides:  1) a detailed description of the acoustic-trawl method (ATM) used by NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center for direct assessments of the dominant coastal pelagic species (CPS; i.e.:  Pacific Sardine _Sardinops sagax_, Northern Anchovy _Engraulis mordax_, Pacific Mackerel _Scomber japonicus_, Jack Mackerel _Trachurus symmetricus_, Pacific Herring _Clupea pallasii_, and Round Herring _Etrumeus acuminatus_) in the California Current Ecosystem off the west coast of the United States (U.S.) and sometimes portions of Canada and Baja CA, Mexico; 2) a description of the new multi-function trawl (MFT) system and sea trials conducted during five days at sea (DAS) at the beginning of the survey; and 3) estimates of the biomasses, distributions, and demographics of those CPS encountered in the survey area between `r survey.start` and `r survey.end` `r survey.year`.  

The core survey region, which was sampled by NOAA ship _`r survey.vessel.long`_ (hereafter, _`r survey.vessel`_), spanned most of the continental shelf between `r survey.landmark.s`, CA and `r survey.landmark.n`. Planned transects were oriented approximately perpendicular to the coast, from the shallowest navigable depth (~20 m) to a distance of 35 nmi offshore or, if farther, to the 1,000 ftm (~1830 m) isobath. In the SCB, transects in the core region were extended to approximately 100 nmi.      

Because navigation by _`r survey.vessel`_ in water shallower than ~20 m was deemed inefficient, unsafe, or both, fishing vessels _Long Beach Carnage_ and _Lisa Marie_ sampled CPS in the nearshore region, along 2.5 to 5 nmi-long transects spaced 5 to 7 nmi-apart off the mainland coast of the U.S., between San Diego and Cape Flattery, as well as around Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands in the Southern CA Bight. In the nearshore region, the acoustically-sampled CPS were apportioned using the species compositions and length distributions from either the nearest daytime purse-seine sets by _Long Beach Carnage_ or _Lisa Marie_ or nighttime trawl from _`r survey.vessel`_.  

The biomasses (metric tons, hereafter tons or t), distributions, and demographics for each species and subpopulation are for the survey area and period, and therefore may not represent their entire population or subpopulation. Sampling was also conducted in the core and nearshore regions off Baja CA by IMIPAS (formerly INAPESCA), but the estimates in this report are only derived from data collected by  _`r survey.vessel`_, _Long Beach Carnage_, and _Lisa Marie_.  

The estimated biomass of the northern subpopulation of Northern Anchovy was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=2)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t, CV = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$biomass.cv[be.all.summ$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%). In the core region, the biomass was `r prettyNum(be.all$Biomass[be.all$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=4)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all$lower.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=2)` - `r prettyNum(be.all$upper.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t, CV = `r prettyNum(be.all$biomass.cv[be.all$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%), and in the nearshore region the biomass was `r prettyNum(be.all.ns$Biomass[be.all.ns$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.ns$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.ns$lower.ci.B[be.all.ns$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.ns$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=1)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.ns$upper.ci.B[be.all.ns$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.ns$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=2)` t, CV = `r prettyNum(be.all.ns$biomass.cv[be.all.ns$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.ns$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%), or `r prettyNum((be.all.ns$Biomass[be.all.ns$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.ns$Stock == "Northern"] / (be.all.ns$Biomass[be.all.ns$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.ns$Stock == "Northern"] + be.all$Biomass[be.all$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all$Stock == "Northern"]))*100,big.mark=",",digits=2)`% of the total biomass. The northern subpopulation was sparsely distributed between Astoria and Cape Flattery, and the distribution of standard lengths ($L_S$) ranged from `r length.summ$L.min[length.summ$scientificName == 'Engraulis mordax' & length.summ$stock == "Northern"]` to `r length.summ$L.max[length.summ$scientificName == 'Engraulis mordax' & length.summ$stock == "Northern"]` cm with a mode at 15 cm in both regions.

The estimated biomass of the central subpopulation of Northern Anchovy was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Central"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Central"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Central"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t, CV = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$biomass.cv[be.all.summ$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Central"],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%).

The estimated biomass of the central subpopulation of Northern Anchovy, which has comprised the majority of CPS biomass since 2015, decreased `r prettyNum((1-(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Central"]/biomass.pct.anch.c$biomass[biomass.pct.anch.c$year == 2023]))*100,,big.mark=",",digits=2)`% from the `r prettyNum(biomass.pct.anch.c$biomass[biomass.pct.anch.c$year == 2023],big.mark=",",digits=5)` t estimated in summer 2023 [@Stierhoff2024].

The estimated biomass of the northern subpopulation of Pacific Sardine was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Sardinops sagax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Sardinops sagax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Sardinops sagax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t, CV = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$biomass.cv[be.all.summ$Species == 'Sardinops sagax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%).

The northern subpopulation was observed between Pt. Conception and Monterey, and between Astoria and Cape Flattery in the core region, and in the nearshore region was mostly observed between Pt.

# Introduction {#introduction}  

In the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), multiple coastal pelagic fish species (CPS; i.e.:  Pacific Sardine _Sardinops sagax_, Northern Anchovy _Engraulis mordax_, Jack Mackerel _Trachurus symmetricus_, Pacific Mackerel _Scomber japonicus_, and Pacific Herring _Clupea pallasii_) comprise the bulk of the forage fish assemblage. These populations, which can change by an order of magnitude within a few years, represent important prey for marine mammals, birds, and larger migratory fishes [@Field2001], and some are targets of commercial fisheries.   

During summer and fall, the northern subpopulation of Pacific Sardine typically migrates north to feed in the productive coastal upwelling off OR, WA, and Vancouver Island [@Zwolinski2012, and references therein, **Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-distribution)**]. In synchrony, but separately, the southern subpopulation of Pacific Sardine migrates from Northern Baja CA, Mexico to the Southern CA Bight (SCB) [@Smith2005]. The predominantly piscivorous adult Pacific and Jack Mackerels also migrate north in summer, but go farther offshore to feed [@Zwolinski2014 and references therein]. In the winter and spring, the northern subpopulation of Pacific Sardine typically migrates south  to its spawning grounds, generally off Central and Southern CA [@Demer2012] and occasionally off OR and WA [@Lo2011]. These migrations vary in extent with population size; fish age and length; and oceanographic conditions [@Zwolinski2012]. The transition zone chlorophyll front [TZCF, @Polovina2001] may delineate the offshore and southern limit of both Pacific Sardine and Pacific Mackerel habitat [e.g., @Demer2012; @Zwolinski2012], and juveniles may have nursery areas in the SCB, downstream of upwelling regions. In contrast, Northern Anchovy spawn predominantly during winter and closer to the coast where seasonal down-welling increases retention of their eggs and larvae [@Bakun1982]. Pacific Herring spawn in intertidal beach areas [@Love1996]. The northern subpopulation of Northern Anchovy is located off WA and OR and the central subpopulation is located off Central and Southern CA and northern Baja CA. Whether a species migrates or remains in an area depends on its reproductive and feeding behaviors, affinity to certain oceanographic or seabed habitats, and its population size.  

Acoustic-trawl method (ATM) surveys, which combine information collected with echosounders and nets, were introduced to the CCE more than 50 years ago to survey CPS off the west coast of the United States (U.S.) [@Mais1974;@Mais1977;@Smith1978]. Following a two-decade hiatus, the ATM was reintroduced in the CCE in spring 2006 to sample the then-abundant Pacific Sardine population [@Cutter2008]. Since then, this sampling effort has continued and expanded through annual or semi-annual surveys [@Zwolinski2014; @Demer2012]. Beginning in 2011, the ATM estimates of Pacific Sardine abundance, age structure, and distribution have been incorporated in the annual assessments of the northern subpopulation [@Hill2017; @Kuriyama2020; @Kuriyama2022b]. ATM estimates are also used in assessments of Pacific Mackerel [@Crone2015; @Crone2019] and the central subpopulation of Northern Anchovy [@Kuriyama2022a]. Additionally, ATM survey results have yielded estimated abundances, demographics, and distributions of epipelagic and semi-demersal fishes [e.g., @Swartzman1997; @Williams2013; @Zwolinski2014] and zooplankton [@Hewitt2000].  

This document, and references herein, describes in detail the ATM as presently used by NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) to survey the distributions, abundances, and demographics of CPS and their oceanographic environments [e.g., @Cutter2008; @Demer2012; @Zwolinski2014]. In general terms, the contemporary ATM combines information from satellite-sensed oceanographic conditions, multifrequency echosounders, probe-sampled oceanographic conditions, trawl-net catches of juvenile and adult CPS, and sometimes pumped samples of fish eggs. The summer survey area spans the continental shelf and adjacent waters to the 1000 fathom isobath off the west coast of the U.S., is expanded to encompass the potential habitat of the northern subpopulation of Pacific Sardine (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-distribution)**), and as time permits, further expanded to encompass as much of the potential habitat as possible for other CPS present over the shelf along the west coasts of Canada and Baja CA.   

Along transects in the survey area, multi-frequency split-beam echosounders transmit sound pulses downward beneath the ship and receive echoes from animals and the seabed in the path of the sound waves. Measurements of sound speed and absorption from conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) probes allow accurate compensation of these echoes for propagation losses. The calibrated echo intensities, normalized to the range-dependent observational volume, provide indications of the target type and behavior [e.g., @Demer2009].  

(ref:sardine-distribution) Conceptual spring (shaded region) and summer (hashed region) distributions of potential habitat for the northern subpopulation of Pacific Sardine along the west coasts of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The dashed and dotted lines represent, respectively, the approximate summer and spring positions of the 0.2 mg m^–3^ chlorophyll-a concentration isoline. This isoline appears to oscillate in synchrony with the transition zone chlorophyll front [TZCF, @Polovina2001] and the offshore limit of the northern subpopulation Pacific Sardine potential habitat [@Zwolinski2011]. Mackerels are found within and on the edge of the same oceanographic  habitat [e.g., @Demer2012; @Zwolinski2012]. The TZCF may delineate the offshore and southern limit of both Pacific Sardine and Pacific Mackerel distributions, and juveniles may have nursery areas in the SCB, downstream of upwelling regions.

Echoes from marine organisms are a function of their body composition, shape, and size relative to the sensing-sound wavelength, and their orientation relative to the incident sound waves [@Cutter2009;@Demer2009;@Renfree2009]. Variations in echo intensity across frequencies, known as echo spectra, indicate the taxonomic groups contributing to the echoes. The CPS, with highly reflective swim bladders, create high intensity echoes of sound pulses at all echosounder frequencies [e.g., @Conti2003]. In contrast, krill, with acoustic properties closer to those of the surrounding seawater, produce lower intensity echoes, particularly at lower frequencies [e.g., @Demer2003]. The echo energy attributed to CPS, based on empirical echo spectra [@Demer2012], are apportioned to species using trawl-catch proportions [@Zwolinski2014].  

Animal densities are estimated by dividing the summed intensities attributed to a species by the length-weighted average echo intensity, i.e., the mean backscattering cross-section, from animals of that species [e.g., @Demer2012]. Transects with similar densities are grouped into post-sampling strata that mimic the natural patchiness of the target species [e.g., @Zwolinski2014]. An estimate of abundance is obtained by multiplying the average estimated density in the stratum by the stratum area [@Demer2012]. The associated sampling variance is calculated using non-parametric bootstrap of the mean transect densities. The total abundance estimate in the survey area is the sum of abundances in all strata. Similarly, the total variance estimate is the sum of the variance in each stratum.  

The primary objectives of the SWFSC’s ATM surveys are to survey the distributions, abundances, and demographics of CPS, and their abiotic environments in the CCE. Typically, summer surveys are conducted during 50-90 days-at-sea (DAS) between June and October. When they occur, spring surveys are conducted during 25-40 DAS between March and May and focus primarily on the northern subpopulation of Pacific Sardine and the central subpopulation of Northern Anchovy. In summer, the ATM surveys also include the northern subpopulation of Northern Anchovy and Pacific Herring. During spring and summer, biomasses are also estimated for other CPS (e.g., Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, and Round Herring) present in the survey area.  

In `r tolower(survey.season)` `r survey.year`, the ATM survey was conducted by _`r survey.vessel`_ from `r survey.landmark.s` to `r survey.landmark.n`. From San Diego to Cape Flattery, sampling from fishing vessels _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_ was used to estimate the biomasses of CPS in the nearshore regions, where sampling by _`r survey.vessel`_ was not possible or safe. 

Presented here are:  1) a detailed description of the ATM used to survey CPS in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) off the west coast of the U.S.; and 2) estimates of the abundances, biomasses, spatial distributions, and demographics of CPS, specifically the northern and southern subpopulations of Pacific Sardine; the central and northern subpopulations of Northern Anchovy, Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, Pacific Herring, and Round Herring for the core and nearshore survey regions in which they were sampled. A complementary survey off Baja CA by IMIPAS used approximately the same sampling protocol. Data from that survey, including biomass estimates for CPS in those core and nearshore regions, are reported elsewhere **[add citation for Vallarta2025, if available]**.  

The SWFSC's survey was conducted with the approval of the Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores (SRE, Diplomatic note UAN0731/2024), the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI; Authorization: LIG0032024, through official letter 400./67/2024), Unidad de Planeación y Coordinación Estratégica de la Secretaría de Marina (SEMAR; Letter no DAI-1305-24), Unidad Coordinadora de Asuntos Internacionales (UCAI) de la Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT; Letter UCAI/01210/2024), Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM; Letter ICML/DIR/182/2024), Unidad de Concesiones y Servicios del Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones (IFT; Letter IFT/223/UCS/01962/2024), and the Comisión Nacional de Acuacultura y Pesca (CONAPESCA; Permit: PPFE/DGPPE.04357-210524).

# Methods {#methods}
## Sampling {#methods-data-collection}
### Design {#methods-survey-design}  

The `r tolower(survey.season)` `r survey.year` survey was conducted principally using _`r survey.vessel`_, but was augmented with nearshore acoustic and purse-seine sampling by two fishing vessels, _Long Beach Carnage_ and _Lisa Marie_. The sampling domain between `r survey.landmark.s` and `r survey.landmark.n` was defined by the conceptual distribution of potential habitat for the northern subpopulation of Pacific Sardine in summer (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-distribution)**), but also encompassed an unknown portion of the anticipated distributions of the southern subpopulation of Pacific Sardine and the central and northern subpopulations of Northern Anchovy off the west coasts of the U.S. It also spanned portions of the Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Herring populations. East to west, the sampling domain extended from the coast to at least the 1,000 ftm (~1830 m) isobath (**Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**). Considering the expected distribution of the target species, the acceptable uncertainty in biomass estimates, and the available ship time (`r survey.das` days at sea, DAS), the primary objective was to estimate the biomasses, spatial distributions, and demographics of the northern subpopulation of Pacific Sardine and the northern subpopulation of Northern Anchovy, whose expected distributions were encompassed by the survey region. Secondary objectives were to estimate the biomasses, spatial distributions, and demographics of the southern subpopulation of Pacific Sardine, central subpopulation of Northern Anchovy, Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, Pacific Herring, and Round Herring, since their expected distributions extend beyond the planned survey region.  

The core region transects were perpendicular to the coast, extending from the shallowest navigable depth (~20 m) to either a distance of 35 nmi or, where farther, to the 1,000 ftm isobath (**Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**). Compulsory transects were spaced 10 nmi apart in U.S. waters, and 20 nmi apart off Baja CA and Vancouver Is. Compulsive transects were shortened to 30 nmi off Baja CA, and adaptive transects were spaced 20 nmi apart off Vancouver Island. When CPS were observed within the westernmost 3 nmi of a transect, that transect and the next one to the north were extended in 5-nmi increments until no CPS were observed in the last 3 nmi of the extension, to a maximum extension of 50 nmi. In most years, transects are sampled in a north-to-south direction. In `r tolower(survey.season)` `r survey.year`, transects were sampled south-to-north to coordinate sampling with the IMIPAS' CPS survey conducted aboard R/V _Jorge Carranza Fraser_.  

To estimate the abundances and biomasses of CPS in the nearshore region between San Diego and Cape Flattery, where _`r survey.vessel`_ could not efficiently or safely navigate or trawl, two fishing vessels conducted acoustic and purse-seine sampling (magenta lines, **Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**). _Long Beach Carnage_ sampled to ~5-m depth along 5-nmi-long transects spaced 5 nmi apart between San Diego and Pacific Grove, CA, and 2.5-nmi-long transects spaced 2.5 nmi apart around Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands in the SCB. _Lisa Marie_ sampled transects to ~5-m depth, spaced 7 nmi apart between Pacific Grove and Cape Flattery (**Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**). Off OR, _Lisa Marie_ conducted coordinated comparative nighttime purse-seine sampling in the core region where _`r survey.vessel`_ observed backscatter from CPS during the day.  

(ref:survey-plan) Planned compulsory transects sampled by NOAA Ships _`r survey.vessel`_ (black lines); adaptive transects to be sampled by FSVs when target CPS are present (dashed red lines); and nearshore transects sampled by _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_ (magenta lines). White points indicate planned UCTD stations. Isobaths (light gray lines) are 50, 200, 500, and 2,000 m.

### Acoustic {#methods-acoustic-sampling}
#### Acoustic equipment {#methods-acoustic-equipment}
##### _`r survey.vessel`_  

Multi-frequency Wide-Bandwidth Transceivers (`r echo.freqs.dash[survey.vessel.primary]`kHz Simrad EK80 WBTs; Kongsberg) were configured with split-beam transducers (Simrad `r echo.models[survey.vessel.primary]`, respectively; Kongsberg). The transducers were mounted on the bottom of a retractable keel or "centerboard" (**Fig. \@ref(fig:cb-config)**). The keel was retracted (transducers at ~`r cb.retracted`-m depth) during calibration, and extended to the intermediate position (transducers at ~`r cb.intermediate`-m depth) during the survey. Exceptions were made during shallow water operations, when the keel was retracted; or during times of heavy weather, when the keel was extended (transducers at ~`r cb.extended`-m depth) to provide extra stability and reduce the effect of weather-generated noise. In addition, acoustic data were also collected using a multibeam echosounder (Simrad ME70; Kongsberg), multibeam sonar (Simrad MS70; Kongsberg), scanning sonar (Simrad SX90; Kongsberg), acoustic Doppler current profiler and echosounder (Simrad EC150-3C, Kongsberg), and a separate ADCP (Ocean Surveyor OS75; Teledyne RD Instruments). Transducer position and motion were measured at 5 Hz using an inertial motion unit (Applanix POS-MV; Trimble).

##### _Lisa Marie_  

On _Lisa Marie_, multi-frequency Wideband Transceivers (`r echo.freqs.dash["LM"]`kHz Simrad EK80 WBTs; Kongsberg) were connected to the vessel's hull-mounted split-beam transducers (Simrad `r echo.models["LM"]`; Kongsberg). The transducers were mounted in a blister on the hull at a water depth of ~4 m (**Fig. \@ref(fig:cb-config-lm)**).  

##### _Long Beach Carnage_

On _Long Beach Carnage_, the SWFSC's multi-frequency General Purpose Transceivers (`r echo.freqs.dash["LBC"]`kHz Simrad EK60 GPTs; Kongsberg) were configured with the SWFSC's split-beam transducers (Simrad `r echo.models["LBC"]`; Kongsberg) mounted in a multi-frequency transducer array (MTA4) on the bottom of a retractable pole (**Fig. \@ref(fig:cb-config-lbc)**). The transducers were at a water depth of roughly 2 m.

#### Echosounder calibrations {#methods-echosounder-calibration}  
##### _`r survey.vessel`_

The echosounder systems aboard _`r survey.vessel`_ were calibrated on `r cal.datetime["RL"]` while the vessel was docked at `r cal.loc["RL"]` (`r cal.lat.dd["RL"]` $^{\circ}\textrm{N}$, `r cal.lon.dd["RL"]` $^{\circ}\textrm{W}$) using the standard sphere technique [@Foote1987; @Demer2015]. Each WBT was calibrated in both CW (i.e., continuous wave or narrowband mode) and FM mode (i.e., frequency modulation or broadband mode). The reference target was a `r cal.sphere["RL"]`; for FM mode, additional calibrations were conducted for the 120, 200, and 333-kHz echosounders using a 25-mm WC sphere (WC25). Prior to the calibrations, temperature and salinity were measured to a depth of 10 m using a handheld probe (Pro2030, YSI) to estimate sound speeds at the transducer and sphere depths, and the time-averaged sound speed and absorption coefficients for the range between them. The theoretical target strength ($TS$; dB re 1 m^2^) of the sphere was calculated using values for the sphere, sound-pulse, and seawater properties. The sphere was positioned throughout the main lobe of each of the transducer beams using three motorized downriggers, two on one side of the vessel and one on the other. The calibration parameters for all vessels were derived in Echoview. For each echosounder, the calibrated Equivalent Two-Way Beam Angle (EBA) was derived by compensating the factory-measured EBA by the change in local sound speed [@Demer2015;@Bodholt2002]; when processing the survey transects, the calibrated measures of transducer gain, beamwidths, and EBA were then also compensated by the changes in local sound speed. The WBTs were configured using the calibration results via the control software (Simrad EK80 `r ek80.version`; Kongsberg; **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results)**). Calibration plots for WBTs in CW and FM mode are presented in  **Appendix \@ref(appendix-calibration-plots-rl-cw)** and **Appendix \@ref(appendix-calibration-plots-rl-fm)**, respectively.

Prior to the survey, on-axis gain ($G_0$), beam angles, angle offsets, and $S_A$ Correction ($S_\mathrm{A}\mathrm{corr}$) values from calibration results were entered into the WBT control software (Simrad EK80; Kongsberg).

##### _Lisa Marie_  

The WBTs aboard _Lisa Marie_ were calibrated prior to the survey on `r cal.datetime["LM"]` using the standard sphere technique [@Foote1987; @Demer2015], while the vessel was anchored in `r cal.loc["LM"]` (`r cal.lat.dd["LM"]` $^{\circ}\textrm{N}$, `r cal.lon.dd["LM"]` $^{\circ}\textrm{W}$). Due to poor calibration results, a second calibration was conducted in Gig Harbor, WA (47.3344 $^{\circ}\textrm{N}$, -122.5817 $^{\circ}\textrm{W}$) on **16 September**. Results for post-survey _Lisa Marie_ calibration presented in **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results-lm)** were used to process the acoustic data used to estimate biomasses.

##### _Long Beach Carnage_

The GPTs aboard _Long Beach Carnage_ were calibrated on 18 April, using the standard sphere technique [@Foote1987; @Demer2015], in a tank at the SWFSC [@Demer2015]. Calibration results for _Long Beach Carnage_ are presented in **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results-lbc)**, and were used to configure the GPTs prior to the survey via the control software.

#### Data collection {#methods-acoustic-data-collection}  
\

On _`r survey.vessel`_, the computer clocks were synchronized with the GPS clock (UTC) using synchronization software (NetTime^[http://timesynctool.com]). The 18-kHz WBTs, operated by a separate PC from the other echosounders, were programmed to track the seabed and output the detected depth to the ship’s Scientific Computing System (SCS). The echosounders were controlled by the EK80 Adaptive Logger [EAL^[https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/science-data/ek80-adaptive-logger/], @Renfree2016]. The EAL optimizes the pulse interval based on the seabed depth, while avoiding aliased seabed echoes, and was programmed such that once an hour the echosounders would record three pings in passive mode, for obtaining estimates of the background noise level. Acoustic sampling for CPS-density estimation along the pre-determined transects was limited to daylight hours (approximately between sunrise and sunset).  

During daytime aboard _`r survey.vessel`_, measurements of volume backscattering strength ($S_v$; dB re 1 m^2^ m^-3^) and target strength ($TS$; dB re 1 m^2^), indexed by time and geographic positions provided by GPS receivers, were logged to 60 m beyond the detected seabed range or to a maximum range of `r raw.log.range["RL"]` m for 38, 70, 120, 200, and 333 kHz, respectively, and stored, with a `r raw.size`-GB maximum file size, in Simrad-EK80 .raw format. At nighttime, echosounders were set to FM mode to improve target strength estimation and species differentiation for CPS in the depths sampled by the surface trawls, and logged to `r raw.log.range.night["RL"]` m to reduce data volume. For each acoustic instrument, the prefix for the file names is a concatenation of the survey name (e.g.,  `r survey.name`), the operational mode (CW or FM), and the logging commencement date and time from the EK80 software. For example, file generated by the EK80 software (`r ek80.version`) for a WBT operated in CW mode is named `2407RL-CW-D20240801-T125901.raw`.  

To minimize acoustic interference, transmit pulses from all echosounders and sonars (e.g., EK80, ME70, MS70, SX90, EC150-3C, and ADCP) were triggered using a synchronization system (Simrad K-Sync; Kongsberg). The K-Sync trigger rate, and thus echosounder ping interval, was modulated by the EAL using the seabed depth measured using the 18-kHz echosounder. During daytime, the ME70, MS70 (_`r survey.vessel`_ only), and SX90 (_`r survey.vessel`_ only) were operated continuously, but only recorded at the discretion of the acoustician during times when CPS were present. During daytime, the ADCP was operated and data were recorded continuously. All other instruments that produce sound within the echosounder bandwidths were secured during daytime survey operations. Exceptions were made during stations (e.g., plankton sampling and fish trawling) or in shallow water when the vessel's command occasionally operated the bridge's 50- and 200-kHz echosounders (Furuno), the Doppler velocity log (SRD-500A; Sperry Marine), or both. At nighttime, only the EK80 and EC-150 were operated. Analyses of data from the ADCP, EC-150, ME70, MS70, and SX90 are not presented in this report.  

On _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_, the EAL was used to control the EK80 software to modulate the echosounder recording ranges (`r raw.log.range["LM"]` m for 38, 70, 120, and 200 kHz, respectively) and ping intervals to avoid aliased seabed echoes. When the EAL was not utilized, the EK80 was set to "auto-range" mode to adjust the maximum ping rate and recording range. Transmit pulses from the echosounders and fishing sonars were not synchronized. Therefore, the latter was secured during daytime acoustic transects.  

### Oceanographic {#methods-oceanographic-sampling}
#### Conductivity and temperature versus depth (CTD) {#methods-ctd-sampling}  
\
Conductivity and temperature were measured versus depth to `r ctd.cast.depth` m (or to within ~10 m of the seabed if shallower than `r ctd.cast.depth` m) with calibrated sensors on a CTD rosette (Model SBE911+, Seabird) or underway probe [RapidPro Plus (UCTD); Valeport] cast from the vessel. One to three casts were planned along each acoustic transect (**Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**). These data were used to calculate the harmonic mean sound speed [@Demer2015] for estimating ranges to the sound scatterers, and frequency-specific sound absorption coefficients for compensating signal attenuation of the sound pulse between the transducer and scatterers [@Simmonds2005] (see **Section \@ref(methods-sound-calcs)**).  

#### Scientific Computer System {#methods-scs-sampling}  
\
While underway, information about the position and direction (e.g., latitude, longitude, speed, course over ground, and heading), weather (air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and barometric pressure), and sea-surface oceanography (e.g., temperature, salinity, and fluorescence) were measured continuously and logged using the ship's Scientific Computer System (SCS). The data from a subset of these sensors, logged with a standardized format at 1-min resolution, are available on NOAA's ERDDAP data server^[`r paste0(erddap.url, erddap.vessel,".html")`].  

<!-- ###  Fish-eggs {#methods-cufes-sampling}   -->

<!-- On _`r survey.vessel`_, fish eggs were sampled during the day using a continuous underway fish egg sampler [CUFES, @Checkley1997], which collects water and plankton at a rate of ~640 l min^-1^ from an intake at ~3-m depth on the hull of the ship. The particles in the sampled water were sieved by a 505-$\mu$m mesh. Pacific Sardine, Northern Anchovy, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Hake (_Merluccius productus_) eggs were identified to species, counted, and logged. Eggs from other species (e.g., Pacific Mackerel and flatfishes) were also counted and logged as "other fish eggs." Typically, the duration of each CUFES sample was 30 min, corresponding to a distance of 5 nmi at a speed of 10 kn. Because the durations of the early egg stages are short (i.e., less than 3 d) for most fish species, the egg distributions inferred from CUFES indicated the presence of actively spawning fish, and were used in combination with CPS echoes to select trawl locations.   -->

### Species and Demographics {#methods-trawl-sampling}  

The net catches provide information about species composition, lengths, weights and ages of CPS sampled acoustically during the day. Nighttime trawls conducted from FSVs sampled fish dispersed in the upper ~20-30 m of the sea surface. After sunset, schools of CPS and other fish tend to ascend and disperse and are less likely to avoid a trawl net [@Mais1977]. Beginning in the summer of 2023, and when weather conditions were favorable, the trawl net was towed along an arced path so that the net fished outside of the ship's wake [@Nottestad2015]. In 2024, a new, Multifunction Trawl Net System (MFT; Swan Nets, Seattle, WA; **Figs. \@ref(fig:trawl-diagram-net)** and **\@ref(fig:trawl-diagram-codend)**), was used to trawl at night. Daytime purse-seine nets were set nearshore by participating fishing vessels to sample CPS schools where their depth is constrained by the seabed and their vision is obscured by turbidity due to primary production and suspended particulates.  

#### Trawl gear {#methods-trawl-gear}  

Aboard _`r survey.vessel`_, the MFT was towed at the surface for 30 min at a speed of ~3.5 kn. The net has a rectangular opening with an area of approximately 648 m^2^ (~18-m tall x 36-m wide), a throat with variable-sized mesh, and a "marine mammal excluder device" to prevent the capture of large animals, such as dolphins, turtles, or sharks while retaining target species [@Dotson2010], and an 8-mm square-mesh cod-end liner (to retain a large range of animal sizes). The trawl doors (Type 22 VK 4m2; Thyboron) had adjustable attachment points and flaps and to modulate the depth of the doors and the trawl headrope was configured with mesh pockets to allow for the addition of up to **ten** A4 floats to adjust the depth of the net. Temperature-depth recorders (TDRs; RBRduet^3^ T.D., RBR) were attached to the kite and footrope to monitor the headrope depth and vertical net opening, and net mensuration sensors (Simrad PxPos sensors; Kongsberg) were installed on the doors that provided real-time measurements of door pitch, roll, depth, and spread to monitor net performance (**Fig. \@ref(fig:tv80-example)**).  

#### Purse-seine gear {#methods-seine-sampling}  

_Lisa Marie_ used an approximately 440-m-long and 40-m-deep purse-seine net with 17-mm-wide mesh (A. Blair, pers. comm.). _Long Beach Carnage_ used an approximately 200-m-long and 27-m-deep purse-seine net with 17-mm-wide mesh; a small section on the back end of the net had 25-mm-wide mesh (R. Ashley, pers. comm.). Specimens collected by _Lisa Marie_ were processed aboard the vessel by the WA Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW; see see **Section \@ref(methods-seine-processing-lm)**) and specimens collected aboard _Long Beach Carnage_ were processed ashore by the CA Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW; see **Section \@ref(methods-seine-processing-lbc)**)).

#### Sampling locations {#methods-trawl-locations}  
##### _`r survey.vessel`_ {#methods-trawl-locations-lasker}  

Up to three nighttime (i.e., 30 min after sunset to 30 min before sunrise) surface trawls, typically spaced at least 10-nmi apart, were conducted in areas where echoes from putative CPS schools were observed earlier that day. Each evening, trawl locations were selected by an acoustician based on the locations of CPS schools in echograms that day. If no CPS echoes were observed along a transect that day, the trawls were alternately placed nearshore that night and offshore the next night, with consideration given to the seabed depth and the modeled distribution of CPS habitat. The locations were provided to the watch officers who charted the proposed trawl sites. Each morning, after the last trawl or no earlier than 30 min prior to sunrise, _`r survey.vessel`_ resumed sampling at the location where the acoustic sampling stopped the previous day.  

##### _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_ {#methods-seine-locations}  

On _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_, as many as three purse-seine sets were conducted each day where CPS schools were observed at the surface or in echograms, including evenings. For each set, three dip-net samples were collected that were spatially separated as much as possible.  

#### Sample processing {#methods-sample-processing}  
##### _`r survey.vessel`_  {#methods-trawl-processing}

If the total volume of the trawl catch was less than or equal to five 35-l baskets (~175 l), all target species were separated from the catch, sorted by species, weighed, and enumerated. If the volume of the entire catch was more than five baskets, a random five-basket subsample that included non-target species was collected, sorted by species, weighed, and enumerated; the remainder of the total catch was weighed. In these cases, the weight of the entire catch was calculated as the sum of the subsample and remainder weights. The weight of the $e$-th species in the total catch ($C_{T,e}$) was obtained by summing the catch weight of the respective species in the subsample ($C_{S,e}$) and the corresponding catch in the remainder ($C_{R,e}$), which was calculated as:  

\begin{equation}
C_{R,e} = C_R*P_{w,e}\text{,}
(\#eq:remainder-catch-weight)
\end{equation}

where $P_{w,e} = C_{S,e}/\sum_1^sC_{S,e}$, is the proportion in weight of the $e$-th species in the subsample. The number of specimens of the $e$-th species in the total catch ($N_{T,e}$) was estimated by:  

\begin{equation}
N_{T,e} = \frac{C_{T,e}}{\overline{w}_e}\text{,}
(\#eq:number-specimens-catch)
\end{equation}

where $\overline{w}_e$ is the mean weight of the $e$-th species in the subsample. For Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy with 75 specimens or fewer, individual measurements of standard length ($L_S$) in mm and weight ($w$) in g were recorded. For Jack Mackerel, Pacific Mackerel, Pacific Herring, Round Herring, or Pacific Hake with 50 specimens or fewer, individual measurements of fork length ($L_F$) and $w$ were recorded. In addition, sex and maturity were recorded for up to 75 Pacific Sardine. Ovaries were only preserved for Pacific Sardine that were considered active and spawning. Fin clips were removed from 75 Pacific Sardine and 50 Northern Anchovy specimens from seven geographic zones (with boundaries at the Columbia River, Cape Mendocino, San Francisco Bay, Point Conception, San Diego, and San Quentin, Baja CA) and preserved in ethanol for genetic analysis. Otoliths were removed from all 75 Pacific Sardine in the subsample; for Northern Anchovy, Pacific Mackerel, and Jack Mackerel, 25 otoliths were removed as equally as possible from the range of sizes present. The combined catches in up to three trawls per night (i.e., trawl cluster) were used to estimate the proportions of species contributing to the nearest samples of acoustic backscatter.  

##### _Lisa Marie_ {#methods-seine-processing-lm}  

For each dip-net sample, all specimens were sorted, weighed, and counted to provide a combined weight and count for each species. Next, all three dip-net samples were combined and up to 50 specimens of each CPS species were randomly sampled to provide individual measures of weight and length (mm; $L_S$ for Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy and $L_F$ for all others), and weight (g) for each set. Otoliths were extracted, macroscopic maturity stage was determined visually, and gonads were collected and preserved from female specimens. For some specimens, fin clips were collected and stored in blotter paper for later genetic analysis.  

##### _Long Beach Carnage_ {#methods-seine-processing-lbc}  

For each dip-net sample, all specimens were sorted, weighed, and counted to provide a combined weight and count for each species. Then all dip net samples were combined and as many as 50 specimens of each CPS species present were chosen randomly throughout the sample and frozen for later analysis by CDFW biologists, yielding individual measures of weight (g); length (mm; $L_S$ for Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy and $L_F$ for all others); maturity; and otolith-derived ages. No female gonad samples were analyzed. For some specimens, fin clips were collected in the laboratory from specimens that were frozen at sea, and those samples were stored in ethanol for later genetic analysis.  

#### Quality Assurance and Quality Control {#methods-trawl-qaqc}  

At sea, trawl data were entered into a database (Microsoft Access). During and following the survey, data were further scrutinized and verified, or corrected. Missing length ($L_{miss}$) and weight ($W_{miss}$) measurements were estimated as $W_{miss} = \beta_0{L}^{\beta_1}$ and $L_{miss} = (W/\beta_0)^{(1/\beta_1)}$, respectively, where values for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are species- and season-specific parameters of the length-versus-weight relationships described in Palance et al. [-@Palance2019]. To identify measurement or data-entry errors, length and weight data were graphically compared (**Fig.** \@ref(fig:lw-plot)) to measurements from previous surveys and models of season-specific length-versus-weight from previous surveys [@Palance2019]. Outliers were flagged, reviewed, and corrected if errors were identified. Catch data were removed from aborted or unacceptable trawl hauls.

From 31 August to 6 September, off the coast of central OR, _Lisa Marie_ conducted nighttime purse seine sampling in areas where CPS backscatter was observed earlier that day, and where _`r survey.vessel`_ conducted nighttime trawling on the same evening (**Fig.** \@ref(fig:trawl-seine-comp-map)). Prior to sunset, acousticians aboard _`r survey.vessel`_ provided the crew of up _Lisa Marie_ up to three planned trawl locations for that evening. Upon completion of each trawl, _Lisa Marie_ attempted to set their purse seine as close as possible in space and time to the trawl location. Catches from both vessels were processed in the same manner as those from the main portion of the survey. Species proportions and size distributions were compared to examine similarities and differences between the two net sampling methods used to apportion acoustic backscatter observed in the core survey area.

## Acoustic data processing {#methods-data-processing}  
### Acoustic and oceanographic data {#methods-acoustic-processing}  

The calibrated echosounder data from each transect were processed using commercial software ([Echoview](https://www.echoview.com/) `r ev.version`; Echoview Software Pty Ltd.) and estimates of the sound speed and absorption coefficient calculated with contemporaneous data from CTD probes cast while stationary or underway (UCTD, see **Section \@ref(methods-ctd-sampling)**). Data collected along the daytime transects at speeds $\geq$ 5 kn were used to estimate CPS densities. Nighttime acoustic data were not used for biomass estimations because they are assumed to be negatively biased due to diel-vertical migration and disaggregation of the target species’ schools [@Cutter2008].  

### Sound speed and absorption calculation {#methods-sound-calcs}  

**Update this section to describe the sound speed profiles applied in Echoview**

Pressure measured in CTD casts was used to derive depths averaged in 1-m bins. Sound speed in each bin ($c_{w,i}$, m s^-1^) was estimated from the average salinity, density, and pH [if measured, else pH = 8; @Chen1977; @Seabird2013]. The harmonic sound speed in the water column ($\overline{c}_w$, m s^-1^) was calculated over the upper 70 m as:  

\begin{equation}
\overline{c}_w = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \Delta r_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \Delta r_i/c_{w,i}}\text{,}
(\#eq:time-avg-sound-speed)
\end{equation}

where $\Delta r$ is the depth of increment $i$ [@Seabird2013]. Measurements of seawater temperature ($t_w$, $^{\circ}\textrm{C}$), salinity ($s_w$, psu), depth, pH, and $\overline{c}_w$ are also used to calculate the mean absorption coefficients ($\overline{\alpha}_a$, dB m^-1^) over species-specific portion of the profile, using equations in Francois and Garrison [-@Francois1982a], Ainslie and McColm [-@Ainslie1998], and Doonan et al. [-@Doonan2003]. Both $\overline{c}_w$ and $\overline{\alpha}_a$ are later used to estimate ranges to the sound scatterers to compensate the echo signal for spherical spreading and attenuation during propagation of the sound pulse from the transducer to the scatterer range and back [@Simmonds2005]. The CTD rosette, when cast, also provides measures of fluorescence and dissolved oxygen concentration versus depth, which may be used to estimate the vertical dimension of Pacific Sardine potential habitat [@Zwolinski2011], particularly the depth of the upper-mixed layer where most epipelagic CPS reside. The latter information is used to inform echo classification (see **Section \@ref(methods-echo-classification)**).  

### Echo classification {#methods-echo-classification}  

Echoes from schooling CPS (**Figs. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)a, d**) were identified using a semi-automated data processing algorithm implemented using Echoview software (`r ev.version`; Echoview Software Pty Ltd). The filters and thresholds were based on a subsample of echoes from randomly selected CPS schools. The aim of the filter criteria is to retain at least 95% of the noise-free backscatter from CPS while rejecting at least 95% of the non-CPS backscatter (**Fig. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)**). Data from _`r survey.vessel`_, _Lisa Marie_, and _Long Beach Carnage_ were processed using the following steps:  

**[Check for changes in 2024, and confirm that methods were equivalent for all 3 platforms]**

1. Match geometry of all $S_v$ variables to the 38-kHz $S_v$;
2. Remove passive-mode pings;
3. Estimate and subtract background noise using the background noise removal function [@DeRobertis2007] in Echoview (**Figs. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)b, e**);
4. Average the noise-free $S_v$ echograms using non-overlapping 11-sample by 3-ping bins;
5. Expand the averaged, noise-reduced _S~v~_ echograms with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation;
6. For each pixel, compute: $S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$, $S_{v,\mathrm{120kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$, and $S_{v,\mathrm{70kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$;
7. Create a Boolean echogram for $S_v$ differences in the CPS range: $-13.85 < S_{v,\mathrm{70kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 9.89 \text{ and} -13.5 < S_{v,\mathrm{120kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 9.37 \text{ and} -13.51 < S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 12.53$;
8. For 120 and 200 kHz, compute the squared difference between the noise-filtered $S_v$ (Step 3) and averaged $S_v$ (Step 4), average the results using an 11-sample by 3-ping window to derive variance, then compute the square root to derive the 120- and 200-kHz standard deviations ($\sigma_{\mathrm{120kHz}}$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{200kHz}}$, respectively);
9. Expand the standard deviation echograms with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation;
10. Create a Boolean echogram based on the standard deviations in the CPS range: $\sigma_{\mathrm{120kHz}}$ > -65 dB and $\sigma_{\mathrm{200kHz}}$ > -65 dB. Diffuse backscattering layers have low $\sigma$ [@Zwolinski2010] whereas fish schools have high $\sigma$;
11. Intersect the two Boolean echograms to create an echogram with "TRUE" samples for candidate CPS schools and "FALSE" elsewhere;
12. Mask the noise-reduced echograms using the CPS Boolean echogram (**Figs. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)c, f**);
13. Create an integration-start line `r int.start` m below the transducer (~10 m depth);
14. Create an integration-stop line `r adz.range` m above the estimated seabed [@Demer2009a], or to the maximum logging range (e.g., `r int.stop` m), whichever is shallowest;
15. Set the minimum $S_v$ threshold to -60 dB (corresponding to a density of approximately three 20-cm-long Pacific Sardine per 100 m^3^);
16. Integrate the volume backscattering coefficients ($s_V$, m^2^ m^-3^) attributed to CPS over 5-m depths and averaged over 100-m distances;
17. Output the resulting nautical area scattering coefficients ($s_A$; m^2^ nmi^-2^) and associated information from each transect and frequency to comma-delimited text (.csv) files.  

When necessary, the start and stop integration lines were manually edited to exclude reverberation due to bubbles, include the entirety of shallow CPS aggregations, and exclude seabed echoes.  

### Removal of non-CPS backscatter {#methods-backscatter-removal}  

In addition to echoes from target CPS, echoes may also be present from other pelagic fish species (Pacific Saury, _Cololabis saira_), or semi-demersal fish such as Pacific Hake and rockfishes ($Sebastes$ spp.). When analyzing the acoustic-survey data, it was therefore necessary to filter "acoustic by-catch," i.e., backscatter not from the target species. To exclude these echoes, echograms were visually examined using R and integration depths were edited to exclude echoes where the seabed was hard and rugose, or where diffuse schools are observed either near the surface or deeper than ~250 m (**Fig. \@ref(fig:extract-nasc)**). In areas dominated by Pacific Herring, for example off Vancouver Island, backscatter was integrated to a maximum depth of 75 m.  

(ref:ev-filtering-example) Two examples of echograms depicting CPS schools (red) and plankton aggregations (blue and green) at 38 kHz (top) and 120 kHz (bottom). Example data processing steps include the original echogram (a, d), after noise subtraction and bin-averaging (b, e), and after filtering to retain only putative CPS echoes (c, f).

In this example, the upper (blue) and lower lines (green) indicate boundaries within which echoes were retained. Where the lower boundary was deeper than the seabed (black line), echoes above the seabed were retained. Echoes from deep, bottom-dwelling schools of non-CPS fishes with swimbladders, and from diffuse scatterers near the surface were excluded. The proximity of the echoes to the seabed was also used to define the lower limit for vertical integration.

```  

### Quality Assurance and Quality Control {#methods-acoustics-qaqc}  

The largest 38-kHz integrated backscattering coefficients ($s_A$, m^2^ nmi^-2^) were graphically examined to identify potential errors in the integrated data (e.g.,  when a portion of the seabed was accidentally integrated, not shown). If found, errors were corrected and data were re-integrated prior to use for biomass estimation.  

### Echo integral partitioning and acoustic inversion {#methods-echointegration}  

For fishes with swimbladders, the acoustic backscattering cross-section of an individual ($\sigma_{bs}$, m^2^) depends on many factors but mostly on the acoustic wavelength and the swimbladder size and orientation relative to the incident sound pulse. For echosounder sampling conducted in this survey, $\sigma_{bs}$ is a function of the dorsal-surface area of the swimbladder and was approximated by a function of fish length ($L$), i.e.:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{bs} = 10^{\frac{m\,\log_{10}(L)+b}{10}}\text{,}
(\#eq:sigma-bs)
\end{equation}

where $m$ and $b$ are frequency and species-specific parameters that are obtained theoretically or experimentally (see references below). $TS$, a logarithmic representation of $\sigma_{bs}$, is defined as:

\begin{equation}
TS = 10\,\log_{10}(\sigma_{bs}) = m\,\log_{10}(L) + b\text{.}
(\#eq:ts-sigma-bs-equation)
\end{equation}

$TS$ has units of dB re 1 m^2^ if defined for an individual, or dB re 1 m^2^ kg^-1^ if defined by weight. The following equations for $TS_{38\mathrm{kHz}}$, were used in this analysis:  

\begin{equation}
TS_{\mathrm{38kHz}} = -14.90 \times \log_{10} (L_T) - 13.21 \text{, for Pacific Sardine;}
(\#eq:tl-ts-sardine)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
TS_{\mathrm{38kHz}} = -11.97 \times \log_{10} (L_T) - 11.58561 \text{, for Pacific and Round Herrings;}
(\#eq:tl-ts-herring)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
TS_{\mathrm{38kHz}} = -13.87 \times \log_{10} (L_T) - 11.797 \text{, for Northern Anchovy; and}
(\#eq:tl-ts-anchovy)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
TS_{\mathrm{38kHz}} = -15.44 \times \log_{10} (L_T) - 7.75 \text{, for Pacific and Jack Mackerels,}
(\#eq:tl-ts-mackerel)
\end{equation}

where the units for total length ($L_T$) is cm and $TS$ is dB re 1 m^2^ kg^-1^.  

Equations \@ref(eq:tl-ts-sardine) and \@ref(eq:tl-ts-mackerel) were derived from echosounder measurements of $\sigma_{bs}$ for in situ fish and measures of $L_T$ and $W$ from concomitant catches of South American Pilchard (_Sardinops ocellatus_) and Horse Mackerel (_Trachurus trachurus_) off South Africa [@Barange1996]. Because mackerels have similar $TS$ [@Pena2008], Equation \@ref(eq:tl-ts-mackerel) is used for both Pacific and Jack Mackerels. For Pacific Herring and Round Herring, Equation \@ref(eq:tl-ts-herring) was derived from that of Thomas et al. [-@Thomas2002] measured at 120 kHz with the following modifications: 1) the intercept used here was calculated as the average intercept of Thomas et al.'s spring and fall regressions; 2) the intercept was compensated for swimbladder compression after Zhao et al. [-@Zhao2008] using the average depth for Pacific Herring of 44 m; 3) the intercept was increased by 2.98 dB to account for the change of frequency from 120 to 38 kHz [@Saunders2012]. For Northern Anchovy, Equation \@ref(eq:tl-ts-anchovy) was derived from that of Kang et al. [-@Kang2009], after compensation of the swimbladder volume [@Ona2003;@Zhao2008] for the average depth of Northern Anchovy observed in summer 2016 [19 m, @Zwolinski2017].  

To calculate $TS_{38\mathrm{kHz}}$, $L_T$ was estimated from measurements of $L_S$ or $L_F$ using linear relationships between length and weight derived from specimens collected in the CCE [@Palance2019]: for Pacific Sardine, $L_T = 0.3574 + 1.149L_S$; for Northern Anchovy, $L_T = 0.2056 + 1.1646 L_S$; for Pacific Mackerel, $L_T = 0.2994 + 1.092 L_F$; for Jack Mackerel $L_T = 0.7295 + 1.078 L_F$; and for Pacific Herring $L_T = -0.105 + 1.2 L_F$. Since a conversion does not exist for Round Herring, the equation for Pacific Herring was used to estimate $L_T$, when present.  

The proportions of species in a trawl cluster were considered representative of the proportions of species in the vicinity of the cluster. Therefore, the proportion of the echo-integral from the $e$-th species ($P_e$) in an ensemble of $s$ species can be calculated from the species catches $N_1, N_2,..., N_s$ and the respective average backscattering cross-sections $\sigma_{bs_1}, \sigma_{bs_2},...,\sigma_{bs_s}$ [@Nakken1975]. The acoustic proportion for the $e$-th species in the $a$-th trawl ($P_{ae}$) is:

\begin{equation}
P_{ae} = \frac{N_{ae} \times \overline{w}_{ae} \times \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae}}{\sum_{e=1}^{s_a} (N_{ae} \times \overline{w}_{ae} \times \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae})}\text{, }
(\#eq:acoustic-prop-spp)
\end{equation}

where $\overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae}$ is the arithmetic counterpart of the average target strength ($\overline{TS}_{ae}$) for all $n_{ae}$ individuals of species $e$ in the random sample of trawl $a$:  

\begin{equation}
\overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n_{ae}}10^{(TS_i/10)}}{n_{ae}}\text{, }
(\#eq:avg-ts-all-spp)
\end{equation}

and $\overline{w}_{ae}$ is the average weight: $\overline{w}_{ae} = \sum_{i=1}^{n_{ae}}{w_{aei}}/{n_{ae}}$. The total number of individuals of species $e$ in a trawl $a$ ($N_{ae}$) is obtained by: $N_{ae}=\frac{n_{ae}}{w_{s,ae}} \times w_{t,ae}$, where $w_{s,ae}$ is the weight of the $n_{ae}$ individuals sampled randomly, and $w_{t,ae}$ is the total weight of the respective species' catch.  

The trawls within a cluster were combined to reduce sampling variability (see **Section \@ref(methods-trawl-clustering)**), and the number of individuals caught from the $e$-th species in a cluster $g$ ($N_{ge}$) was obtained by summing the catches across the $h$ trawls in the cluster: $N_{ge}=\sum_{a=1}^{h_g}N_{ae}$. The backscattering cross-section for species $e$ in the $g$-th cluster with $a$ trawls is then given by:  

\begin{equation}
\overline{\sigma}_{bs,ge}=\frac{\sum_{a=1}^{h_g} N_{ae} \times \overline{w}_{ae} \times \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae}}{\sum_{a=1}^{s_g} N_{ae} \times \overline{w}_{ae}}\text{, }
(\#eq:sigma-spp-j)
\end{equation}

where:  

\begin{equation}
\overline{w}_{ge} = \frac{\sum_{a=1}^{h_g} N_{ae} \times \overline{w}_{ae}}{\sum_{a=1}^{h_g} N_{ae}}\text{, }
(\#eq:w-spp-j)
\end{equation}

and the proportion ($P_{ge}$) is;

\begin{equation}
P_{ge} = \frac{N_{ge} \times \overline{w}_{ge} \times \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae}}{\sum_{e=1}^{s}(N_{ge} \times \overline{w}_{ge} \times \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ge})}\text{.}
(\#eq:prop-spp-j)
\end{equation}  

### Trawl clustering and species proportion {#methods-trawl-clustering}  

**[PLEASE REVIEW: Updated section to include purse seine catches for the nearshore proportions,which wasn't mentioned previously.]**

Nighttime trawl and daytime purse seine samples were used to apportion backscatter in the core and nearshore areas, respectively. Trawls that occurred on the same night were assigned to a trawl cluster. Biomass densities ($\rho$) were calculated for 100-m transect intervals by dividing the integrated area-backscatter coefficients for each CPS species by the mean backscattering cross-sectional area [@MacLennan2002] estimated in the trawl cluster or purse seine nearest in space. Acoustic transects were post-stratified to account for spatial heterogeneity in sampling effort and biomass density in a similar way to that performed for Pacific Sardine [@Zwolinski2016].  

For a generic 100-m long acoustic interval, the area-backscattering coefficient for species $e$: $s_{A,e} = s_{A,cps} \times P_{ge}$, where $P_{ge}$ is the species acoustic proportion of the nearest trawl cluster or purse seine (Equation \@ref(eq:prop-spp-j)), was used to estimate the biomass density ($\rho_{w,e}$) [@MacLennan2002; @Simmonds2005] for every 100-m interval, using the size and species composition of the nearest (space and time) trawl cluster (**Fig. \@ref(fig:trawl-cluster-map)**) or purse seine (**Fig. \@ref(fig:trawl-cluster-map-ns)**):

\begin{equation}
\rho_{w,e} = \frac{s_{A,e}}{4\pi\overline{\sigma}_{bs,e}}\text{.}
(\#eq:biomass-density)
\end{equation}

In 2024, purse seine sampling was sparse in some areas where CPS backscatter was observed, so the nearest purse seine or trawl cluster were used to apportion backscatter, whichever was closest in space (**Fig. \@ref(fig:trawl-cluster-map-ns)**).  

The biomass densities were converted to numerical densities using: $\rho_{n,e}=\rho_{w,e}/\overline{w}_e$, where $\overline{w}_e$ is the corresponding mean weight. Also, for each acoustic interval, the biomass or numeric densities are partitioned into length classes according to the species' length distribution in the respective trawl cluster.

## Data analysis {#methods-data-analysis}
### Post-stratification {#methods-post-stratification}  

The transects were the sampling units [@Simmonds1996]. Because each species does not generally span the entire survey area [@Zwolinski2014; @Demer2017], the sampling domain was stratified for each species and subpopulation. Strata were defined by uniform transect spacing (i.e., sampling intensity) and either the presence (i.e., positive densities and potentially structural zeros) or absence (i.e., real zeros) of biomass for each species. Each stratum has: 1) at least three transects, with approximately equal spacing, 2) fewer than three consecutive transects with zero-biomass density, and 3) bounding transects with zero-biomass density (**Fig. \@ref(fig:tx-biom-dens)**). This approach tracks patchiness and creates statistically-independent, stationary, post-sampling strata [@Johannesson1983; @Simmonds1992]. For Northern Anchovy, we define the separation between the northern and central subpopulations at `r names(stock.break.anch)` (`r round(stock.break.anch,1)` $^{\circ}\textrm{N}$). For Pacific Sardine, the northern subpopulation biomass present in the survey area [@Hill2014; @Felix-Uraga2004; @Felix-Uraga2005; @Garcia-Morales2012] was separated using the revised model of Pacific Sardine potential habitat [@Zwolinski2023c] during the survey (**Figs. \@ref(fig:transects-and-habitat-all)**, with all other Pacific Sardine biomass considered to belong to the southern subpopulation. This separation is further supported by different distributions of $L_S$ and a break in the distribution of Pacific Sardine biomass, which, in this survey, coincided geographically with `r names(stock.break.sar)` (`r round(stock.break.sar, 1)` $^{\circ}\textrm{N}$, **Fig. \@ref(fig:tx-biom-dens)**).  

### Analysis of deep backscatter in the nearshore region  

**[Significant deep backscatter that was likely anchovy as observed by the LM near Pacific Grove. The nearest purse seine set was in northern Monterey Bay and contained entirely sardine. The decision was made to use the nearest purse seine OR trawl cluster to apportion nearshore backscatter. ]** 

In some areas, substantial backscatter was observed deeper than the upper mixed layer (approximately 30-m deep) in the nearshore region (**Fig. \@ref(fig:plot-thermocline-scb)**) **[Update figure]**. In those areas, the purse-seine catches sampled using a 27-m deep net contained mostly Pacific Sardine, which typically reside above the thermocline (J. Zwolinski, unpublished data), but also Northern Anchovy. Therefore, the CPS backscatter shallower than **30 m** was apportioned using the length and species composition of all CPS in the nearest purse seine sample or trawl cluster, and the CPS backscatter deeper than 30 m was assumed to be Northern Anchovy with length compositions corresponding to the nearest purse-seine set or trawl cluster containing Northern Anchovy. **[Still need to estimate biomass from deep backscatter.]**

### Biomass and sampling precision estimation {#methods-biomass-and-precision}  

For each stratum and subpopulation, the biomass ($\hat{B}$; kg) of each species was estimated by: 

\begin{equation}
\hat{B} = A \times \hat{D}\text{, }
(\#eq:biomass-mean)
\end{equation}

where $A$ is the stratum area (nmi^2^) and $\hat{D}$ is the estimated mean biomass density (kg nmi^-2^):

\begin{equation}
\hat{D} = \frac{\sum_{l=1}^{k}\overline{\rho}_{w,l} c_l}{\sum_{l=1}^{k}c_l}\text{, }
(\#eq:biomass-mean-density)
\end{equation}

where $\overline{\rho}_{w,l}$ is the mean biomass density of the species on transect $l$, $c_l$ is the transect length, and $k$ is the total number of transects. The variance of $\hat{B}$ is a function of the variability of the transect-mean densities and associated lengths. Treating transects as replicate samples of the underlying population [@Simmonds1996], the variance was calculated using bootstrap resampling [@Efron1981] based on transects as sampling units. Provided that each stratum has independent and identically-distributed transect means (i.e., densities on nearby transects are not correlated, and they share the same statistical distribution), bootstrap or other random-sampling estimators provide unbiased estimates of variance.

The 95% confidence intervals (CI~95%~) for the mean biomass densities ($\hat{D}$) were estimated as the 0.025 and 0.975 percentiles of the distribution of `r boot.num` bootstrap survey-mean biomass densities. Coefficient of variation (CV, %) values were obtained by dividing the bootstrapped standard error by the mean estimate [@Efron1981]. Total biomass in the survey area was estimated as the sum of the biomasses in each stratum, and the associated sampling variance was calculated as the sum of the variances across strata.  

### Abundance- and biomass-at-length estimation {#methods-abundance-at-length}  

The numerical densities by length class (**Section \@ref(methods-trawl-clustering)**) were averaged for each stratum in a similar way for that used for biomass (Equation \@ref(eq:biomass-mean-density)), and multiplied by the stratum area to obtain abundance per length class.  

### Percent biomass per cluster contribution {#methods-cluster-biomass-density}  

The percent contribution of each cluster to the estimated abundance in a stratum (**Appendix \@ref(appendix-cluster-length-percent)**) was calculated as:  

\begin{equation}
\frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^{l}\overline{\rho}_{ci}}{\Sigma_{c=1}^{C}\Sigma_{i=1}^{l}\overline{\rho}_{ci}}{\text{,}}
(\#eq:pct-acoustic-biomass)
\end{equation}

where $\overline{\rho}_{ci}$ is the numerical density in interval $i$ represented by the nearest trawl cluster $c$.

At the beginning of Leg 1, `r num2words(5)` days at sea (DAS) were allocated for drills, training, additional sea trials with the multi-function trawl (MFT) net system, and underway echosounder calibrations (see below).  

The core region of the `r tolower(survey.season)` `r survey.year` survey spanned the continental shelf from the Punta Eugenia, Baja California, Mexico to Cape Scott, Vancouver Island, between `r format(ymd(erddap.survey.start),"%d %B")` and `r format(ymd(erddap.survey.end),"%d %B %Y")`, and included most of the potential habitat for the northern subpopulation of Pacific Sardine at the time of the survey^[https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/sardine_habitat_modis.html]. In this region, _`r survey.vessel`_ (`r das.rl-5` DAS) sampled `r nrow(nasc.summ)` east-west transects totaling `r prettyNum(sum(nasc.summ$distance), digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` nmi (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-trawl)**). Catches from a total of `r nrow(haul)` nighttime surface trawls were combined into `r n_distinct(haul$cluster)` trawl clusters. In the core region, one to `r num2words(max(as.numeric(be$Stratum), na.rm = TRUE))` post-survey strata were defined by their transect spacing and the densities of biomass attributed to each species. 

The nearshore region spanned an area from 5-m depth to approximately 5 nmi from the continental coast, or 2.5 nmi from the Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands, between Cape Flattery and San Diego. _Long Beach Carnage_ (`r das.lbc` DAS) surveyed from approximately San Diego to Carmel, CA, and around the Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands, with `r nrow(nasc.summ.lbc.ns)` east-west transects totaling `r sprintf("%.0f",sum(nasc.summ.lbc.ns$distance))` nmi and `r set.summ$n[set.summ$vessel.name == "LBC"]` purse-seine sets (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lbc)**). _Lisa Marie_ (`r das.lm` DAS) surveyed from approximately Pacific Grove, CA to Cape Flattery, WA with `r nrow(nasc.summ.lm.ns)` east-west transects totaling `r sprintf("%.0f",sum(nasc.summ.lm.ns$distance))` nmi and `r set.summ$n[set.summ$vessel.name == "LM"]` purse-seine sets (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lm)**). In the nearshore region, one to `r num2words(max(as.numeric(be.ns$Stratum),na.rm = T))` post-survey strata were defined by their transect spacing and the densities of biomass attributed to each species.

Biomasses and abundances were estimated for each species and subpopulation in both the core and nearshore survey regions. The total biomass for each subpopulation within the survey region was estimated as the sum of its biomasses in the core and nearshore regions.  

**Leg I**

*Multi-Function Trawl (MFT) Net Testing*  

Leg I aboard _Lasker_ departed from 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego, CA at 19:30 (all times UTC) on June 25, 2024. The first day consisted of drills, shipboard Operational Readiness Training (ORT), and equipment setup. Prior to sailing, the ship underwent a refit of its entire network to a new Fortinet solution, as part of OMAO's Ocean Data Lake initiative. The next five days (26-30 June) were spent testing the new Multi-Function Trawl (MFT) net and familiarizing personnel with its operations. On 27 June, the Cetacean Health and Life History Program from SWFSC's Marine Mammal and Turtle Division (MMTD) rendezvoused with _Lasker_ outside San Diego Bay to conduct drone footage of the MFT during operations. On 29 June, Greg Shaughnessey (Ocean Golds Seafood, Inc.) and Seamus Melly (Swan Nets) departed _Lasker_ via a small boat. On 30 June, another small-boat transfer was conducted to certain personnel for the remainder of Leg 1. During the transfer, _Lasker_ conducted a calibration of the EC150-3C ADCP at 32.602 N, 117.287 W following the protocols as prescribed by Kongsberg, which involved the ship moving in multiple clockwise and counterclockwise circles. After completing a successful calibration, _Lasker_ then transited to 32.542 N / 117.184 W and dropped anchor in approximately 30-m of water. Once anchored, calibrations of the EC150-3C echosounder and ME70 multibeam sonar were conducted. Upon completion of the calibrations, and after the small boat had returned, _Lasker_ pulled up anchor and began its transit south to Baja California, Mexico, where it would begin the ATM survey.

*ATM survey*

On the morning of 2 July, _Lasker_ commenced acoustic sampling on Transect 001 in Sebastián Vizcaíno Bay to officially begin the 2024 survey. Acoustic and trawl sampling in Baja California, MX proceeded northward along the 20-nmi-spaced transects. On 7 July, _Lasker_ completed the last transect in Mexico, Transect 027C. Between 7-16 July, _Lasker_ continued sampling in the SCB. Due to the long transect lines in the SCB, regional sampling was conducted to ensure adequate biological sampling in both the inshore and offshore regions. On 16 July, _Lasker_ completed the final sampling of Leg I off Huntington Beach, CA. In total, Leg I sampled all transects from Transects 001 to 040. At 05:00 on 17 July, after completing a single trawl for the final evening, _Lasker_ began its transit back to San Diego, CA, arriving at 10th Avenue Marine Terminal at 14:50.

*Nearshore*

On 8 July, _Long Beach Carnage_ was mobilized with EK80 echosounders at Point Loma Sportfishing in San Diego, CA. From 9 to 18 July, _Long Beach Carnage_ sampled nearshore transects 1 to 36, between San Diego and Point Conception, including around Santa Catalina Island.

**Leg II**  

Leg II aboard _Lasker_ departed on Monday, 22 July at 21:30 from 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego, cA. At around 13:00 on 23 July, _Lasker_ resumed acoustic sampling along the nearshore portion of Transect 041 off Huntington Beach. At ~13:00 on 31 July, a lander containing a WBAT and Aural-M2 was recovered off Point Conception, and at ~14:00 a new lander was deployed in the same area (34.439 N / 120.548 W). On 6 August, _Lasker_ transited to Santa Cruz, CA to find calm seas and improved visibility for troubleshooting problems with the X-band radar; ET Trevathan successfully replaced the brushes in the radar antenna motor and the survey resumed the following day with minimal impact to sampling. At ~06:00 on 12 August, acoustic sampling was completed along Transect 075 off Bodega Bay, CA, and at 14:30 _Lasker_ arrived at Pier 76 in San Francisco, CA to conclude Leg II.

*Nearshore*

From 22 to 25 July, _Long Beach Carnage_ sampled nearshore transects 37 to 48, between Point Conception and Morro Bay, including around Santa Cruz Island. Then, from 2 to 3 August, _Long Beach Carnage_ sampled nearshore transects 49 to 54. On 3 August, _Long Beach Carnage_ docked in Monterey, CA, where the acoustic equipment was demobilized for transport back to San Diego, CA.

**Leg III** 

Leg III aboard _Lasker_ departed at 19:30 on Saturday, 17 August from Pier 96 in San Francisco, CA. The first day consisted of drills and shipboard ORT activities, followed by two nighttime trawls in the vicinity of Bodega Canyon. Acoustic sampling then resumed at sunrise on 18 August along Transect 076. On 28 and 29 August, inclement weather precluded trawl sampling.  Moreover, on the evening of 28 August, _Lasker_ was requested by the U.S. Coast Guard to watch over the distressed sailboat _Sundance_ until the following morning. On 31 August, _Lasker_ commenced regional sampling, in part to obtain both inshore and offshore trawls to enable comparative biosampling with _Lisa Marie_. On 6 September, _Lasker_ completed partial acoustic sampling of Transect 124, just outside the mouth of the Columbia River, then conducted a final trawl just north of Tillamook head. _Lasker_ then returned to MOC-P in Newport, OR at 23:00 on 7 September to conclude Leg III.

*Nearshore*

From 7 to 25 August, _Lisa Marie_ sampled nearshore transects 66 to 151, between Monterey, CA and the WA/OR border, returning to port in Westport, WA on 26 August. Then, from 31 August to 6 September, _Lisa Marie_ conducted comparative purse seine sets in close proximity, in both space and time, to _Lasker_ nighttime trawls. Finally, from 7 to 11 September, _Lisa Marie_ sampled nearshore transects 152 to 171, between the WA/OR border and Cape Flattery, WA, to conclude the nearshore survey.

**Leg IV** 

Leg IV aboard _Lasker_ departed from MOC-P in Newport, OR at 16:30 on 13 September after a one-day delay awaiting arrival of an augmenting steward. The first day included drills followed by transiting to and beginning sampling on Transect 124, which had been partially sampled during Leg III. _Lasker_ then continued sampling northward, entering Canadian waters on 21 September to conduct transects off Vancouver Island. Due to time and weather constraints, sampling off Vancouver Island was only conducted on compulsory transects, spaced 20-nmi apart. On 23 September, after acoustically sampling and conducting trawls on Transect 149, _Lasker_ transited to the northernmost transect (Transect 155) off Vancouver Island and resumed sampling from north to south. This decision was made due to an impending weather system, and would optimize sampling effort before _Lasker_ would need to vacate the region. On 24 September, _Lasker_ completed its final transect of the survey, Transect 151, and conducted one last trawl, before transiting to Newport, OR, where _Lasker_ arrived at ~17:00 on 26 September.

## Acoustic backscatter {#results-backscatter-distribution} 

Acoustic backscatter ascribed to CPS was observed throughout the latitudinal range of the core survey area (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-trawl)a**), but was greatest between San Diego and San Francisco. Acoustic backscatter was present from the shore to the shelf break, but was generally greater closer to shore. Zero-biomass intervals were observed at the offshore end of each transect in the core region. Greater than `r cum.biomass.limit*100`% of the biomass for each species was apportioned using catch data from trawl clusters conducted within ~25 nmi (**Fig. \@ref(fig:biomass-cluster-distance)**).  

Acoustic backscatter ascribed to CPS was also observed throughout the nearshore survey area, but was most prevalent along mainland and Channel Island transects sampled by _Long Beach Carnage_ between San Diego and Carmel (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lbc)a**), and along transects sampled by _Lisa Marie_ between Half Moon Bay, CA and San Francisco, and north of Cape Mendocino (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lm)a**).

## Trawl catch {#results-trawl-catch}  

Trawl catches from _`r survey.vessel`_ were comprised of mostly Northern Anchovy between Punta Eugenia and San Francisco, and Jack Mackerel farther north (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-trawl)b**). Pacific Herring were also prevalent in trawl catches between Newport and Cape Flattery. Some Pacific Sardine and Pacific Mackerel were present in trawl clusters offshore in the SCB and close to shore between Newport and Astoria, OR off the Columbia River. Overall, the `r nrow(haul)` trawls captured a combined `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$AllCPS),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of CPS (`r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'Anchovy'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Northern Anchovy, `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'JackMack'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Jack Mackerel, `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'PacHerring'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Herring,`r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'Sardine'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Sardine, `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'PacMack'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Mackerel, and `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'RndHerring'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Round Herring).  

## Purse-seine catch {#results-seine-catch}  
### _Long Beach Carnage_  

Purse-seine catches from _Long Beach Carnage_ in the nearshore region were comprised mostly of Pacific Sardine and Pacific Mackerel (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lbc)b**). In general, Pacific Mackerel were more prevalent in samples collected along the mainland coast south of Los Angeles, CA and around Santa Catalina Island. Relatively few Jack Mackerel, Northern Anchovy, and Round Herring were collected in purse-seine samples collected by _Long Beach Carnage_ (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lbc)b**). Overall, dip-net samples from `r set.summ$n[set.summ$vessel.name == "LBC"]` seines totaled `r prettyNum(sum(seine.summ.lbc$total.wt),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of CPS (`r prettyNum(seine.summ.lbc$total.wt[seine.summ.lbc$scientificName == "Sardinops sagax"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Sardine, `r prettyNum(seine.summ.lbc$total.wt[seine.summ.lbc$scientificName == "Scomber japonicus"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Mackerel, `r prettyNum(seine.summ.lbc$total.wt[seine.summ.lbc$scientificName == "Engraulis mordax"],big.mark=",",digits=2)` kg of Northern Anchovy, `r prettyNum(seine.summ.lbc$total.wt[seine.summ.lbc$scientificName == "Trachurus symmetricus"],big.mark=",",digits=2)` kg of Jack Mackerel, and `r prettyNum(seine.summ.lbc$total.wt[seine.summ.lbc$scientificName == "Etrumeus acuminatus"],big.mark=",",digits=2)` kg of Round Herring).  

### _Lisa Marie_ {#results-seine-catch-lm}  

Purse seine catches from _Lisa Marie_ in the nearshore were comprised mostly of Pacific Herring, except a few catches of Pacific Sardine between Monterey and San Francisco and a few catches of Jack Mackerel and Pacific Mackerel between Cape Blanco and Newport (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lm)b**). Purse seine sampling between Monterey and Cape Mendocino was sparse due to few CPS targets, the presence or marine mammals, that did not permit the deployment of the purse seine gear, or both. Many of the purse seine sets north of Cape Mendocino contained no CPS (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lm)b**). Overall, the dip-net samples from `r set.summ$n[set.summ$vessel.name == "LM"]` purse-seine sets totaled `r prettyNum(sum(seine.summ.lm$total.wt),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of CPS (`r prettyNum(seine.summ.lm$total.wt[seine.summ.lm$scientificName == "Trachurus symmetricus"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Jack Mackerel, `r prettyNum(seine.summ.lm$total.wt[seine.summ.lm$scientificName == "Scomber japonicus"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Mackerel, `r prettyNum(seine.summ.lm$total.wt[seine.summ.lm$scientificName == "Sardinops sagax"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Sardine, `r prettyNum(seine.summ.lm$total.wt[seine.summ.lm$scientificName == "Clupea pallasii"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Herring, and `r prettyNum(seine.summ.lm$total.wt[seine.summ.lm$scientificName == "Engraulis mordax"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Northern Anchovy).

### Round Herring {#results-rher}

The total estimated biomass of Round Herring was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Etrumeus acuminatus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Etrumeus acuminatus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Etrumeus acuminatus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t, CV = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$biomass.cv[be.all.summ$Species == 'Etrumeus acuminatus'],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%, **Table \@ref(tab:biomass-rher)**), and was located between Punta Eugenia and El Rosario off Baja CA and along a few transects north of San Nicolas Island in the SCB (**Fig. \@ref(fig:biom-dens-rher)a**). $L_F$ ranged from `r length.summ$L.min[length.summ$scientificName == 'Etrumeus acuminatus']` to `r length.summ$L.max[length.summ$scientificName == 'Etrumeus acuminatus']` cm with modes at 16, 23, and 26 cm (**Table \@ref(tab:l-freq-summ-rher)**, **Fig. \@ref(fig:l-disagg-rher)**).

_Lisa Marie_ conducted `r num2words(catch.comp.summ$n[catch.comp.summ$sample.type == "Purse seine"])` nighttime purse seine sets in close proximity to the `r num2words(catch.comp.summ$n[catch.comp.summ$sample.type == "Trawl"])` trawl locations sampled by _`r survey.vessel`_. In general, the species composition in catches from nighttime seine samples were similar to those in individual trawl hauls (**Fig. \@ref(fig:trawl-seine-comparison-haul)**) and trawl clusters (**Fig. \@ref(fig:trawl-seine-comparison-cluster)**). One notable exception was the two nearshore locations in the northern part of the area where purse seines collected Pacific Sardine but none were captured in the trawl net. Several of the purse seine samples contained no CPS, but those were farther offshore and nearby trawls contained Jack Mackerel and Pacific Mackerel.  

Similar to species composition, the number and length distributions of CPS specimens were similar between purse seine and trawl samples (**Fig. \@ref(fig:trawl-seine-comparison-lengths-grid)** or **Fig. \@ref(fig:trawl-seine-comparison-lengths-combo)**). No Pacific Sardine were captured in the trawl, and no Northern Anchovy were collected in the purse seine; however, only one Northern Anchovy was collected in the trawls.

# Discussion {#discussion}  

**[The text, figures, and tables have been updated up to this point. I will continue working on the Discussion and Appendices while the other sections are being reviewed, but the text below is incomplete/inaccurate at this point.]**

The primary objective of the ATM surveys is to estimate the biomasses, distributions, and demographics of CPS within the survey area at the time of the survey. The `r tolower(survey.season)` `r survey.year` survey spanned the expected distribution of the northern subpopulation of Pacific Sardine and northern subpopulation of Northern Anchovy in U.S. waters, but also portions of the expected distribution of the southern subpopulation of Pacific Sardine, central subpopulation of Northern Anchovy, Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, Pacific Herring, and Round Herring.  

With the benefit of favorable weather conditions and minimal delays related to mechanical failures, staffing shortages, and other logistical challenges, nearly all of the originally allocated `r survey.das` sea days aboard `r survey.vessel` were successfully executed, and the sampling of the core and nearshore regions in coordination with F/Vs _Long Beach Carnage_ and _Lisa Marie_ was accomplished with minimal temporal and spatial separation, all of which were testament to the planning, preparation, and skill of all parties involved.  

**Discuss:**  

+ Nearest trawl cluster or purse seine sample for nearshore biomass estimates.

## Biomass and abundance
### Northern Anchovy {#discussion-anchovy-biomass} 
#### Northern subpopulation {#discussion-anchovy-biomass-northern} 

The estimated biomass of the northern subpopulation of Northern Anchovy in the survey region north of Cape Mendocino was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all$Stock == "Northern"], big.mark=",", digits = 4)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=4)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=5)` t) in summer 2024. The northern subpopulation biomass has comprised a small fraction (`r round(min(biomass.pct.anch.n$biomass.pct),1)` to `r round(max(biomass.pct.anch.n$biomass.pct),1)`%) of the total CPS biomass in the CCE since at least 2015 [@Stierhoff2021a].

#### Central subpopulation {#discussion-anchovy-biomass-central}  

The estimated biomass of the central subpopulation of Northern Anchovy in the survey region was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all$Stock == "Central"], big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Central"],big.mark=",",digits=5)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Central"],big.mark=",",digits=5)` t) and comprised `r round(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all$Stock == "Central"]/sum(be.all.summ$Biomass)*100)`% of the total CPS biomass in summer 2024. The biomass represents a ~decreased `r prettyNum((1-(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Central"]/biomass.pct.anch.c$biomass[biomass.pct.anch.c$year == 2023]))*100,,big.mark=",",digits=2)`% decrease from the `r prettyNum(biomass.pct.anch.c$biomass[biomass.pct.anch.c$year == 2023],big.mark=",",digits=5)` t estimated in summer 2023 [@Stierhoff2024]. 

**In summer 2024, the biomass of Northern Anchovy below the thermocline (>30 m depth) was `r prettyNum(241822-156926, big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t, which was `r round((241822-156926)/241822*100, 0)`% of the biomass in the nearshore region, and `r round((241822-156926)/be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all$Stock == "Central"]*100, 1)`% of the biomass in the core and nearshore regions combined.** 

In 2015, the ATM survey documented a large recruitment to the central subpopulation of Northern Anchovy, and since 2018, the central subpopulation of Northern Anchovy has been the dominant forage fish species in the survey area (**Figs. \@ref(fig:biomass-ts-combo)a,b**).  

### Pacific Sardine {#discussion-sardine}     
#### Northern subpopulation {#discussion-sardine-biomass-northern} 

**[UPDATE ONCE NS SARDINE BIOMASS IS AVAILABLE]**

The southern extent of northern subpopulation Pacific Sardine habitat was `r names(stock.break.sar)`, based foremost on associations with potential habitat but corroborated by the geographic separation of biomass density north and south of Point Conception, and differences in demographics, growth, and lengths-at-age (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-stock-allocation))**. The estimated biomass of `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all$Stock == "Northern"], big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"], big.mark=",",digits=5)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"], big.mark=",",digits=5)` t) in the survey region was a `r round((be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"]/biomass.pct.sar.n$biomass[biomass.pct.sar.n$year == 2023])-1, digits=3)*100`% increase in biomass compared to the `r prettyNum(biomass.pct.sar.n$biomass[biomass.pct.sar.n$year == 2023],big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t estimated in summer 2023 [@Stierhoff2024].  

+ Nearly all of the NSPS biomass was observed in the nearshore region between Pt. Conception and San Francisco
+ **Other discussion points**

Since 2014, the ATM biomass of the northern subpopulation of Pacific Sardine has remained less than the 150,000 t rebuilding target adopted by the Pacific Fishery Management Council in 2020^[https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2020/08/g-1-attachment-1-pacific-sardine-rebuilding-plan-preliminary-environmental-analysis.pdf/] (**Figs. \@ref(fig:biomass-ts-combo)a,b**).  

#### Southern subpopulation {#discussion-sardine-biomass-southern}  

The estimated biomass of the southern subpopulation of Pacific Sardine was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Southern"], big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Southern"], big.mark=",",digits=5)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Southern"],big.mark=",",digits=5)` t), of which `r prettyNum(be.all.ns$Biomass[be.all.ns$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all.ns$Stock == "Southern"], big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t (`r prettyNum(be.all.ns$Biomass[be.all.ns$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all.ns$Stock == "Southern"]/be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Southern"]*100, big.mark=",", digits = 1)`%) occurred in the nearshore region off southern and central CA.

**[UPDATE/REMOVE] Using the species proportions and lengths from purse-seine catches to apportion backscatter deeper than 30 m resulted in a biomass estimate of 207,320 t in the nearshore region and a total biomass of 213,768 t.**  

The southern subpopulation was first observed in U.S. waters by the SWFSC's ATM surveys in 2016 [`r prettyNum(biomass.pct.sar.s$biomass[biomass.pct.sar.s$year == 2016],big.mark=",", digits = 1)` t, @Stierhoff2021b]. Since then, the southern subpopulation biomass in U.S. waters has been increasing, from `r prettyNum(biomass.pct.sar.s$biomass[biomass.pct.sar.s$year == 2018],big.mark=",", digits = 1)` t in summer 2018 [@Stierhoff2021b] to `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Southern"], big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t in summer 2024. In summer 2017, the summer survey did not extend into the SCB [@Zwolinski2019a], and no summer survey was conducted in 2020 due to COVID-19. The biomass estimated in 2024 is the largest in the time series, which goes back to 2016. In 2024, Mexico conducted a contemporaneous survey of CPS, including the nearshore region **[Update citation to Vallarta2025, if available]**.  

### Pacific Mackerel {#discussion-mack}

In summer 2024, the estimated biomass of Pacific Mackerel in the survey region was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Scomber japonicus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Scomber japonicus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Scomber japonicus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t), which is within the range of recent estimates (`r prettyNum(min(biomass.pct.mack$biomass[biomass.pct.mack$year %in% c(2016:2023)]),big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(max(biomass.pct.mack$biomass[biomass.pct.mack$year %in% c(2016:2023)]),big.mark=",",digits=3)`) between 2016 and 2023.    

### Jack Mackerel {#discussion-jack}  

In summer 2024, the estimated biomass of Jack Mackerel in the survey region was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Trachurus symmetricus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Trachurus symmetricus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Trachurus symmetricus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t), which was `r round(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Trachurus symmetricus']/biomass.pct.jack$biomass[biomass.pct.jack$year == 2023],1)*100`% increase from the `r prettyNum(biomass.pct.jack$biomass[biomass.pct.jack$year == 2023],big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t estimated in summer 2022 [@Stierhoff2023a]. However, **[discuss issues with the 2023 survey and related uncertainty in that estimate; the 2024 estimate is more similar to the estimates in recent years without sampling issues].**    

### Pacific Herring {#discussion-herring} 

In summer 2024, the estimated biomass of Pacific Herring in U.S. waters south of Cape Flattery, was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Clupea pallasii'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Clupea pallasii'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Clupea pallasii'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t), which was a `r (1-round(((be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Clupea pallasii']/biomass.pct.her$biomass[biomass.pct.her$year == 2023])-1)*100,0))`% decrease from the `r prettyNum(biomass.pct.her$biomass[biomass.pct.her$year == 2023],big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t estimated in summer 2023 [@Stierhoff2024].  

### Round Herring {#discussion-rherring} 

**[UPDATE ROUND HERRING INFO]**

In summer 2024, the estimated biomass of Round Herring in U.S. and Mexican waters north of Punta Eugenia was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Etrumeus acuminatus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Etrumeus acuminatus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Etrumeus acuminatus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t). **Discuss the R. herring observed in the SCB, and the fact that this was the first time it was estimated in the nearshore region.**

## Ecosystem dynamics: Forage fish community {#discussion-ecosystem-dynamics}  

**[RESUME HERE]**

The acoustic-trawl method (ATM) has been used to monitor the biomasses and distributions of pelagic and mid-water fish stocks worldwide [e.g., @Coetzee2008; @Karp1994; @Simmonds2009]. In 2006, the SWFSC's ATM survey in the CCE focused on Pacific Sardine [@Cutter2008], but evolved to assess the five most abundant CPS [@Zwolinski2014]: Pacific Sardine, Northern Anchovy, Jack Mackerel, Pacific Mackerel, and Pacific Herring. In the CCE, ATM surveys have been used to directly assess Pacific Hake [@JTC2014; @Edwards2018]; rockfishes [@Starr1996; @Demer2012b; @Demer2012c; @Demer2012d]; Pacific Herring [@Thomas2003]; northern subpopulation of Pacific Sardine [@Hill2017; @Kuriyama2020; @Kuriyama2022b]; northern [@Mais1974; @Mais1977] and central subpopulations [@Kuriyama2022a] of Northern Anchovy; and Pacific Mackerel [@Crone2015; @Crone2019]. The proportions of these subpopulations that are in water too shallow to be sampled by NOAA ships are estimated using samples collected from fishing vessels. Also, concurrent satellite- and ship-based measures of their biotic and abiotic habitats are used to provide an ecosystem perspective.  

Collectively, these annual or bi-annual ATM surveys provide a unique insight into the dynamics of forage fishes in the CCE, including their distributions, abundances, interactions, and environments. For example, results from 2006 through 2013 indicate that Pacific Sardine dominated the CPS assemblage, but their biomass was declining [@Demer2012a; @Zwolinski2012a] and their seasonal migration was contracting [@Zwolinski2014]. Meanwhile, harvest rates for the declining subpopulation increased [@Demer2017], and the total forage-fish biomass decreased to less than 200,000 t in 2014 and 2015 (**Figs. \@ref(fig:biomass-ts-combo)a,b**). The U.S. fishery for Pacific Sardine was closed in 2015 [@NMFS2015], and there were reports of mass strandings, deaths, and reproductive failures in Brown Pelicans (_Pelecanus occidentalis_^[https://e360.yale.edu/features/brown_pelicans_a_test_case_for_the_endangered_species_act]), Common Murres (_Uria aalge_), Brandt’s Cormorants (_Phalacrocorax penicillatus_), and California sea lions (_Zalophus californianus_^[https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-life-distress/2013-2017-california-sea-lion-unusual-mortality-event-california]) [@McClatchie2016], all of which depend on forage species. The National Marine Fisheries Service deemed the subpopulation 'overfished' in 2019.  

The biomass of the central subpopulation of Northern Anchovy, which had been growing rapidly since 2015, increased from the `r prettyNum(biomass.pct.anch.c$biomass[biomass.pct.anch.c$year == 2022],big.mark=",",digits=5)` t estimated in summer 2022 [@Stierhoff2023b]. The southern subpopulation of Pacific Sardine in U.S. waters was mostly in the nearshore region. There is no indication that the biomasses of the northern subpopulation of Pacific Sardine and the northern subpopulation of Northern Anchovy have changed significantly since summer 2022.  

The survey-estimated CPS biomasses since 2008 were dominated by northern subpopulation Pacific Sardine until 2013, Jack Mackerel in 2014 and 2015, and then central subpopulation of Northern Anchovy since 2015, when it was resurgent. The latter subpopulation grew to ~2.75 million tons by 2021 [@Stierhoff2023a], and has hovered around ~2.5 million t since. Meanwhile, the biomass of Pacific Mackerel remained the lowest in the assemblage, and the biomass of Jack Mackerel trended up from 2017 through 2022. In 2023, the delayed and smaller survey in the northern area created uncertainty about the decrease in Jack Mackerel in 2023. The biomasses of northern and southern subpopulations of Pacific Sardine are calculated separately based on oceanographic habitat, spatial separation, and  demographic structure [@Zwolinski2023c]. The southern subpopulation of Pacific Sardine has been present in U.S. waters since at least 2015, located mostly nearshore, south of Monterey Bay; the biomass of the northern subpopulation has been fluctuating below 100,000 t mostly off Oregon and Washington.
