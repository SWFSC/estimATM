# Introduction {#introduction}
The `r survey.name.long` (`r survey.id.sw`) was conducted by the Fisheries Resources Division (FRD) of the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) aboard NOAA Ship _`r survey.vessel.long`_ (hereafter, _`r survey.vessel`_; **Fig. \@ref(fig:lasker-pic)**), `r survey.start` to `r survey.end` `r survey.year`. The Acoustic-Trawl Method (ATM) was used to assess coastal pelagic fish species (CPS) and krill within the CCE. Data were collected using multi-frequency echosounders, surface trawls, vertically and obliquely integrating net tows, a continuous underway fish-egg sampler (CUFES), and conductivity-temperature-depth probes (CTDs).  

The objectives for the survey were to: 1) acoustically map the distributions and estimate the abundances of CPS, i.e., Pacific Sardine _Sardinops sagax_, Northern Anchovy _Engraulis mordax_, Pacific Herring _Clupea pallasii_, Pacific Mackerel _Scomber japonicus_, and Jack Mackerel _Trachurus symmetricus_; and krill (euphausiid spp.); 2) characterize their biotic and abiotic environments, and investigate linkages; 3) gather information regarding their life histories; and 4) evaluate the use of Saildrones to augment the ship-based sampling. Reported elsewhere, the Marine Mammal and Turtle Division (MMTD) of the SWFSC concurrently surveyed the abundances and distributions of whales, dolphins, and seabirds in the survey area; characterized their pelagic ecosystem; and identified certain cetacean species using biopsies and photographs.  

The survey domain encompassed the anticipated distributions of the northern sub-population (stock) of Pacific Sardine and the central and northern stocks of Northern Anchovy off the west coasts of the U.S. and Canada from approximately `r survey.landmark.s`, to `r survey.landmark.n`, but also encompassed a large portion of the anticipated distributions of Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Herring. The survey domain was defined by the modeled distribution of Pacific Sardine potential habitat [@Zwolinski2011], and information recently gathered from other research projects (e.g., California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations [CalCOFI] samples) or the fishing industry (e.g., bycatch of Pacific Sardine).  

This report provides an overview of the survey objectives and a summary of the survey equipment, acoustic-system calibration, sampling and analysis methods, and preliminary results. This report does not include estimates of the distributions and biomasses of CPS, krill, marine mammals, or seabirds; and does not elaborate on the evaluation of Saildrone technology. Advantages and disadvantages to the combination of CPS and marine mammal and seabird sampling are discussed from the ATM perspective.

# Methods {#methods}
## Survey region and design {#methods-survey-design}
During spring, Pacific Sardine typically aggregate offshore of central and southern California to spawn [@Demer2012, and reference therein]. During summer, if the stock is large enough, adults will migrate north, compress along the coast, and feed in the upwelled regions (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-distribution)**).  

During `r tolower(survey.season)` `r survey.year`, the west coast of the United States was surveyed using _`r survey.vessel`_. Compulsory transects were nearly perpendicular to the coast with separations of 10 to 20 nmi. The survey began off `r survey.landmark.n`, and progressed southwards toward `r survey.landmark.s`.  

The planned transects (**Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**) spanned the latitudinal extent of the potential habitat of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine^[http://swfscdata.nmfs.noaa.gov/AST/sardineHabitat/habitat.asp] at the time of the survey (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-habitat)**). Transect positions, lengths, and spaces were adaptively adjusted during the survey according to the observed distribution of putative CPS backscatter in the echosounders, CPS eggs in CUFES, or CPS landed in trawls.

(ref:sardine-distribution) Conceptual spring (shaded region) and summer (hashed region) distributions of potential habitat for the northern stock of Pacific Sardine along the west coasts of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The dashed and dotted lines represent, respectively, the approximate summer and the spring position of the 0.2 mg m^–3^ isoline of chlorophyll-a concentration. This isoline appears to oscillate in synchrony with the transition zone chlorophyll front [TZCF, @Polovina2001] and the offshore limit of the Pacific Sardine potential habitat [@Zwolinski2014]. Mackerels are found within and on the edge of the same oceanographic  habitat [e.g., @Demer2012; @Zwolinski2012]. The TZCF may delineate the offshore and southern limit of both Pacific Sardine and Pacific Mackerel distributions, and juveniles may have nursery areas in the Southern California Bight, downstream of upwelling regions.

## Acoustic sampling {#methods-acoustic-sampling}
### Echosounders {#methods-echosounders}
Multi-frequency (`r echo.freqs` kHz) General Purpose Transceivers (EK60 GPTs, Simrad) and Wideband Transceivers (EK80 WBTs, Simrad) were configured with split-beam transducers (`r echo.models`, respectively; Simrad). The transducers were mounted on the bottom of a retractable keel or "centerboard" (**Fig. \@ref(fig:cb-config)**). The keel was retracted (transducers ~`r cb.retracted`-m depth) during calibration, and extended to the intermediate position (transducers ~`r cb.intermediate`-m depth) during the survey. Exceptions were made during shallow water operations, when the keel was retracted; or during times of heavy weather, when the keel was extended (transducers ~`r cb.extended`-m depth) to provide extra stability and reduce the effect of weather-generated noise (**Appendix \@ref(appendix-cb-pos)**).  

(ref:cb-config) Transducer locations on the bottom of the centerboard aboard _`r survey.vessel`_.

```{r cb-config,fig.cap='(ref:cb-config)',out.width = '6.5in',fig.align='center',fig.pos='H'}

  include_graphics(here("Figs/fig_centerboard_config_RL.png"))
} else {
  include_graphics(here("Figs/fig_centerboard_config_SH.png"))
}
``` 

### Calibration {#methods-echosounder-calibration}
Prior to calibration, the integrity of each transducer was verified through impedance measurements of each transducer in water and air using an LCR meter (Agilent E4980A) and custom Matlab software. For each transducer, impedance magnitude ($|Z|$, $\Omega$), phase ($\theta$, $^\circ$), conductance ($G$, $S$), susceptance ($B$, $S$), resistance ($R$, $\Omega$), and reactance ($X$, $\Omega$) were measured at the operational frequencies with the transducer quadrants connected in parallel (**Appendix \@ref(appendix-impedance-plots)**). The echosounders were calibrated using the standard sphere technique [@Foote1987;@Demer2015]. The reference target was a `r cal.sphere` (`r cal.sphere.name`). The GPTs were configured, via the ER60 software, using the calibration results (see **Section \@ref(results-echosounder-calibration)**).  

### Data collection {#methods-acoustic-data-collection}
Computer clocks were synchronized with the GPS clock (GMT) using synchronization software (NetTime^[http://timesynctool.com]). Echosounder pulses were transmitted simultaneously at all frequencies, at variable intervals, as controlled by the ER60 Adaptive Logger [EAL, @Renfree2016]. The EAL optimizes the pulse interval, based on the seabed depth, while minimizing aliased seabed echoes. Acoustic sampling for CPS-density estimation along the pre-determined transects was limited to daylight hours (approximately between sunrise and sunset).

Measurements of volume backscattering strength ($S_v$; dB re 1 m^2^ m^-3^) and target strength ($TS$, dB re 1 m^2^), indexed by time and geographic positions provided by GPS receivers, were logged to 60 m beyond the detected seabed range or to a maximum of `r raw.log.range` m and stored in Simrad .raw format with a `r raw.size`-MB maximum file size. For each acoustic instrument, the prefix for the file names is a concatenation of the survey name (e.g.,  `r survey.name`), the acoustic system (e.g., EK60, EK80, ME70), and the logging commencement date and time from the GPT-control software. For example, an EK60 file generated by the Simrad ER60 software (`r er60.version`) is named `1807RL-D20180723-T125901.raw`.   

To minimize acoustic interference, transmit pulses from the ME70, the MS70, the SX90, and the acoustic Doppler current profiler (Ocean Surveyor Model OS75, Teledyne RD Instruments) were triggered using the K-Sync synchronization system (Simrad). All other instruments that produce sound within the echosounder bandwidths were secured during daytime survey operations. Exceptions were made during stations (e.g., plankton sampling and fish trawling) or in shallow water when the vessel's command occasionally operated the bridge's 50- and 200-kHz echosounders (Furuno), the Doppler velocity log (Sperry Marine Model SRD-500A), or both.  

### Data processing {#methods-acoustic-data-processing}
Echoes from schooling CPS were identified using a semi-automated data processing algorithm implemented using Echoview software (`r ev.version`). The filters and thresholds were based on a subsample of echoes from randomly selected CPS schools. The aim of the filter criteria is to retain at least 95% of the noise-free backscatter from CPS while rejecting at least 95% of the non-CPS backscatter (**Fig. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)**). The filter includes the following steps:

+ Estimate and subtract background noise using the built-in Echoview background noise removal function [@DeRobertis2007,  **Fig. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)b,e**];
+ Average the noise-free $S_v$ echograms using non-overlapping 11-sample by 3-ping bins;
+ Expand the averaged, noise-reduced _S~v~_ echograms with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation;
+ For each pixel, compute: $S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$, $S_{v,\mathrm{120kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$, and $S_{v,\mathrm{70kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$;
+ Create a Boolean echogram for $S_v$ differences in the CPS range: $-13.85 < S_{v,\mathrm{70kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 9.89 \wedge -135.5 < S_{v,\mathrm{120kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 9.37 \wedge -13.51 < S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 12.53$;
+ Compute the standard deviation (SD) of $S_{v,\mathrm{120kHz}}$ and $S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}$ using non-overlapping 11-sample by 3-ping bins;
+ Expand the SD($S_{v,\mathrm{120kHz}}$) and SD($S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}$) echograms with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation;
+ Create a Boolean echogram based on the SDs in the CPS range: SD($S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}$) > -65 dB $\wedge$ SD($S_{v,\mathrm{120kHz}}$) > -65 dB. Diffuse backscattering layers [@Zwolinski2010] have low standard deviations whereas fish schools have high standard deviations [@Demer2009];
+ Intersect the two Boolean echograms. The resulting echogram has samples with "TRUE" for candidate CPS schools and "FALSE" elsewhere;
+ Mask the noise-reduced echograms using the CPS Boolean echogram (**Fig. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)c,f**);
+ Create an integration-start line at a range of `r int.start` m from the transducer (~10 m depth);
+ Create an integration-stop line `r adz.range` m above the estimated seabed [@Demer2009], or to the maximum logging range (e.g., `r int.stop` m), whichever is shallowest;
+ Set the minimum $S_v$ threshold to -60 dB (corresponding to a density of approximately three fish per 100 m^3^ in the case of 20-cm-long Pacific Sardine);
+ Integrate the volume backscattering coefficients ($s_V$, m^2^ m^-3^) attributed to CPS over 5-m depths and averaged over 100-m distances;
+ Output the resulting nautical area scattering coefficients ($s_A$; m^2^ nmi^-2^) and associated information from each transect and frequency to comma-delimited text (.csv) files.  

When necessary, the start and stop integration lines were manually edited to exclude reverberation due to bubbles, to include the entirety of shallow CPS aggregations, or to exclude seabed echoes.

## Trawl sampling {#methods-trawl-sampling}
During the day, CPS form schools in the upper mixed layer [to 70-m depth in the spring; @Kim2005], and shallower in summer. After sunset, CPS schools tend to ascend and disperse; at that time, with reduced visibility and no schooling behavior, they are less able to avoid a net [@Mais1974]. Therefore, trawl sampling for identifying the species composition and length distributions of acoustic targets was performed at night.  

The net, a Nordic 264 rope trawl (NET Systems; Bainbridge Island, WA), has a rectangular opening in the fishing portion of the net with an area of approximately 300 m^2^ (~15-m tall x 20-m wide), variable-sized mesh in the throat, an 8-mm square-mesh cod end liner (to retain a large range of animal sizes), and a "marine mammal excluder device" to prevent the capture of large animals, such as dolphins, turtles, or sharks [@Dotson2010]. The trawl doors are foam-filled and the trawl headrope is lined with floats so the trawl tows at the surface.  

Up to three nighttime (i.e., 30 min after sunset to 30 min before sunrise) surface trawls, typically spaced 10-nmi apart, were conducted in areas where putative echoes from CPS schools were observed earlier that day. Each evening, trawl locations were selected by an acoustician who monitored CPS echoes and a member of the trawl group who measured the densities of CPS eggs in CUFES. The locations were provided to the watch Officers who charted the proposed trawl sites. Trawl locations were selected using the following criteria, in descending priority: CPS schools in echograms that day, CPS eggs in CUFES that day, and the trawl locations and catches during the previous night. If no CPS echoes or CPS eggs were observed along the transect(s) that day, the trawls were alternatively placed nearshore one night and offshore the next night, with consideration given to the seabed depth and the modeled distribution of CPS habitat.  

Trawls were towed at ~4 kn for 45 min. The total catch from each trawl was weighed and sorted by species or groups. From the catches with CPS, up to 50 fish were selected randomly for each of the target species. Those were weighed (g) and measured to either their standard length ($L_S$; mm) for Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy, or fork length ($L_F$; mm) for Jack Mackerel, Pacific Mackerel, and Pacific Herring. In addition, sex and maturity were recorded for all species; ovaries were preserved for Pacific Mackerel if active, hydrated, or both. Fin clips were removed from Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy and preserved in ethanol for genetic analysis. Otoliths were removed from all 50 Pacific Sardine in the subsample; for other CPS species, 25 otoliths were removed "as equally as possible" from the range of sizes present. Regional species composition was estimated from the nearest trawl cluster, i.e., the combined catches of up to three trawls per night, separated by ~10 nmi.  

## Ichthyoplankton and oceanographic sampling {#methods-other-sampling}
### Egg and larva sampling {#methods-egg-sampling}
During the day, fish eggs were collected using CUFES [@Checkley1997], which collects water and plankton at a rate of ~640 l min^-1^ from an intake on the hull of the ship at ~3-m depth. The particles in the sampled water were sieved by a 505 $\mu$m mesh. Pacific Sardine, Northern Anchovy, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Hake _Merluccius productus_ eggs were identified to species, counted, and logged. Eggs from other species (e.g., flatfishes) were also counted and logged as "other fish eggs". Typically, the duration of each CUFES sample was 30 min, corresponding to a distance of 5 nmi at a speed of 10 kn. Because the duration of the initial stages of the egg phase is short for most fish species, the egg distributions inferred from CUFES indicate the nearby presence of actively spawning fish.  

A CalCOFI bongo oblique net [or bongo; a paired, bridleless, 71-cm diameter net with 505-$\mu$m mesh; @Smith1977] was used to sample ichthyoplankton and krill at one station each day soon after sunset. Where there was adequate depth, 300 m of wire was deployed at a rate of 50 m min^-1^ and then retrieved at 20 m min^-1^, at a nominal wire angle of 45$^\circ$. Bongo samples were stored in 5% buffered formalin.  

### Conductivity and temperature versus depth (CTD) sampling {#methods-ctd-sampling}
Day and night, conductivity and temperature versus depth to `r ctd.depth` m were measured with calibrated sensors on a CTD rosette or underway probe (UCTD) cast from the vessel. These data were used to estimate the time-averaged sound speed [@Demer2004c], for estimating ranges to the sound scatterers, and frequency-specific sound absorption coefficients, for compensating signal attenuation of the sound pulse between the transducer and scatterers [@Simmonds2005]. These data also provided indication of the depth of the upper-mixed layer, where most epipelagic CPS reside during the day, which is later used to determine the integration depth during acoustic data processing.

# Results {#results}
## EK60 echosounder calibration {#results-echosounder-calibration}
The EK60s were calibrated on `r cal.datetime` while the vessel was at anchor near `r cal.loc` (`r cal.lat.dd` $^\circ$N, `r cal.lon.dd` $^\circ$W). Measurements of sea-surface temperature ($t_w$ = `r cal.temp` $^\circ$C) and salinity ($s_w$ = `r cal.sal` psu) to a depth of 10 m were measured using a handheld probe (Pro2030, YSI) and input to the GPT-control software (ER60 `r er60.version`, Simrad), which derived estimates of sound speed ($c_w$ = `r cal.c` m s^-1^) and absorption coefficients (see **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results)**). Varying with tide, the seabed was approximately `r cal.min.z` to `r cal.max.z` m beneath the transducers. The calibration sphere was positioned nominally 5-8 m below the transducers.  

GPT information, configuration settings, and beam model results following calibration are presented in **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results)**. Measurements of uncompensated sphere target strength ($TS_u$, dB re 1 m^2^) are plotted in **Fig. \@ref(fig:tsu-plot)** and beam-compensated sphere target strength ($TS_{rel}$, dB re 1 m^2^), relative to the theoretical target strength, are plotted in **Fig. \@ref(fig:tsc-plot)**.

## Data collection {#results-data-collection}
### Acoustic and trawl sampling {#results-acoustic-trawl-sampling}
The survey spanned an area from approximately `r survey.landmark.n`, to `r survey.landmark.s` (**Fig. \@ref(fig:cruise-track)**), with `r nrow(nasc.summ)` east-west transects totaling `r sprintf("%.0f",sum(nasc.summ$distance))` nmi, and `r nrow(trawl.summ)` Nordic trawls.  

**Leg I**  
On 26 June, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from the Exploratorium (Pier 15) in San Francisco at ~2130 (all times GMT) and began the offshore transit to northern Vancouver Island. Throughout the transit, sampling was conducted during the day with CUFES, EK60s, ME70, MS70 and SX90. The EK80 was run at night only. On 1 July, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the first nearshore station off Cape Scott at 1250 to begin acoustic sampling along transect 126. On 26 June, at the start of the transit, the MS70 was inoperable due to a damaged power supply. On 30 June,  the supply was replaced and the MS70 was fully operational. Acoustic sampling ceased after the completion of transect 90 off Tillamook Bay. On 16 July, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the Marine Operations-Pacific (MOC-P) Pier in Newport, OR, at ~1700 to complete Leg I.  

**Leg II**  
On 21 July, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from  MOC-P Pier in Newport at 0200, and arrived at transect 90 off Tillamook Bay at 1240 on 21 July to resume survey operations. On 6 August, the GPS data to EK60 was lost at ~0930 and then restored at 0220 on 7 July. On 8 August, acoustic sampling ceased after the completion of transect 58 off Cape Mendocino. On 9 August, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the Exploratorium (Pier 15) in San Francisco at ~1300 to complete Leg II. 

**Leg III**  
On 13 August, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from the Exploratorium (Pier 15) in San Francisco at 2200, and arrived at transect 58 off Cape Mendocino at 1750 on 14 August to resume survey operations. On 17 August, the ER60 software crashed and had to be restarted. On 18 August, the ER60 again crashed, and it was discovered the ER60 software was not correctly receiving motion data, which was resolved by changing the baud rate. On 25 August, transect 34 was interrupted to put an injured scientist ashore at Monterey Bay. On 28 August, the final day of acoustic transects, transect 29 was not completed before sunset, and needed to be resampled during Leg 4. On 29 August, at the end of the offshore marine mammal line, a planned trawl was not feasible due to a chaffed line that required repair. On 31 August, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego to complete Leg III.

**Leg IV**
On 05 September, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from the fuel dock of 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego at 2345. During the transit, a lander was successfully deployed near Pt. Conception (34.43875 $^{\circ}\textrm{N}$, 120.5472833 $^{\circ}\textrm{W}$) equipped with a WBAT and AURAL. At 0200 on 07 September, _`r survey.vessel`_ resumed survey operations at the first station south of Big Sur, near the inshore segment of transects 28/29. On 19 September, the UCTD winch failed and was not used for the remainder of the survey. For the remainder of the survey, the CTD rosette was cast up to two times per transect. On 23 September, survey operations concluded with _`r survey.vessel`_'s arrival to the 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego at 0230.  

### Ichthyoplankton and oceanographic sampling {#results-other-sampling}
A total of `r nrow(ctd.sta)` CTD casts and `r nrow(bongo.sta)` bongo tows were conducted throughout the survey. In addition, `r nrow(uctd.sta)` UCTD casts were conducted and `r nrow(cufes.all)` CUFES samples were collected underway. The locations of CTD and UCTD stations are shown in **Fig. \@ref(fig:station-sampling)** and **Appendix \@ref(appendix-ctd-sampling)**.

## Distribution of CPS {#results-cps-distribution}
Acoustic backscatter ascribed to CPS (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)a**) was observed throughout the survey area, but was most prevalent off Cape Flattery, between the Columbia River and Cape Blanco, inshore between Bodega Bay and Morro Bay, CA, and throughout the Southern California Bight.  

Jack Mackerel eggs were the most abundant of any CPS species (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)b**) and were present in the CUFES throughout most of the survey area, found predominately in the offshore portion of transects between Cape Scott and approximately Newport. Northern Anchovy eggs were present in the CUFES samples nearshore off the Columbia River; nearshore between Bodega Bay and Morro Bay; and to a lesser extent in the Santa Barbara Basin south of Pt. Conception. Pacific Sardine eggs, overall small in density, were observed in the CUFES offshore of the Columbia River (obscured by dense Jack Mackerel eggs in the same area); between Cape Blanco and San Francisco; south of Pt. Conception; and near San Diego.  

Jack Mackerel comprised the greatest proportion of catch in trawl samples (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**) between Cape Flattery and San Francisco, and offshore in the Southern CA Bight. Pacific Herring comprised the greatest proportion of catch in trawl samples in Canadian waters, and to a lesser extent in nearshore waters off Newport. Anchovy were predominantly collected in trawls conducted between Westport, WA, and Newport; and between San Francisco and San Diego. Sardine were collected in trawls conducted between the Columbia River and Newport; between Pt. Conception and Long Beach, CA; and to a lesser extent offshore between Crescent City, CA, and Cape Mendocino. Overall, the `r nrow(trawl.summ)` trawls captured a combined `r sprintf("%.0f",haul.CPS.kg)` kg of CPS (`r sprintf("%.0f",haul.Sardine.kg)` kg Pacific Sardine, `r sprintf("%.0f",haul.Anchovy.kg)` kg Northern Anchovy, `r sprintf("%.0f",haul.JackMack.kg)` kg Jack Mackerel, `r sprintf("%.0f",haul.PacMack.kg)` kg Pacific Mackerel, and `r sprintf("%.0f",haul.PacHerring.kg)` kg Pacific Herring; **Appendix \@ref(appendix-trawl-sampling)**).  

# Discussion  
The combination of A-T methods used to survey CPS and line-transect methods used to survey marine mammals and seabirds identified several advantages (pros) and disadvantages (cons) to this combined approach, which are elaborated below from the perspective of the A-T group. 

## Pros:
+ Acoustic transects extended farther offshore than normal, which allowed estimations of population biomasses in offshore strata;
+ Combined sampling provided coincident predator and prey observations, which may be used to estimate predator consumption requirements and foraging areas;
+ Combined sampling slowed the daytime sampling progress, which resulted in higher trawl density in some cases.

## Cons:
+ Acoustic transects extended farther offshore than normal, which reduced the transect densities on the shelf, and caused the survey to progress down the coast faster and with fewer trawls in some higher-density areas;
+ Combined sampling slowed daytime sampling progress, which made the sampling less synoptic;
+ The additional personnel required to conduct the marine mammal and seabird sampling necessarily limited the number of berths available to trawl staff, which made the processing of large trawl catches more difficult.
