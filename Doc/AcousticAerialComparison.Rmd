**Figure 1.** An interactive map of the distribution of 38-kHz integrated backscattering coefficients ($s_A$, m^2^ nmi^-2^;  averaged over 2000-m distance intervals) ascribed to CPS (from 5 to 70-m deep) and krill (5 to 350-m deep); CUFES egg density (eggs m^-3^) for anchovy, sardine, and jack mackerel; catch (by weight) of CPS species in trawl clusters (the combination of up to three trawl hauls conducted within a 12 h period; white points); and some other miscellaneous survey data. Hover-over or click on some map objects for more info. 

# Acoustic biomass density
## By transect (tons)

```{r plot-biomass-density-transect-name,out.width="100%",eval=T}
include_graphics(here("Figs/fig_biomass_density_transect_tx_name.png"))
```

**Figure 2.** Biomass density (t nmi^-2^) versus transect name for each species and survey vessel (labels above plots; e.g., SH = _Bell M. Shimada_, RL = _Reuben Lasker_, LM = _Lisa Marie_). Blue number labels correspond to the transects with positive biomass (t > 0.01) to facilitate discrimination of stratum breaks. Point fills indicate transect spacing (i.e., the shortest distance between the midpoint of each transect and midpoint of all other transects, in nmi), which is used to define different sampling strata, for example when adaptive sampling occurs.

## By latitude (log(tons) + 1)

```{r plot-biomass-density-latitude,out.width="100%",eval=T}
include_graphics(here("Figs/fig_biomass_density_transect_lat.png"))

```

**Figure 3.** Biomass density (log(t + 1) nmi^-2^) versus latitude (easternmost portion of each transect) and strata used to estimate biomass and abundance (shaded regions; outline indicates stratum number) for each species and survey vessel (labels above plots; e.g., SH = _Bell M. Shimada_, RL = _Reuben Lasker_, LM = _Lisa Marie_). Blue number labels correspond to the transect numbers with positive biomass (log(t + 1) > 0.01) to facilitate discrimination of stratum breaks. Point fills indicate transect spacing (i.e., the shortest distance between the midpoint of each transect and midpoint of all other transects, in nmi), which is used to define different sampling strata, for example when adaptive sampling occurs. Dashed lines indicate prominent biogeographic landmarks that delineate stock boundaries (e.g., Cape Mendocino for the central and nothern stocks of Northern anchovy and Pt. Conception for the northern and southern stocks of Pacific sardine).

# Data table

**Table 1.** Biomass density summary ($\sum{(t*nmi^{-2})}$) for each transect.

```{r biomass-density-table}
load(here("Output/nasc_biomass_density.Rdata"))
nasc.density.summ %>% 
  mutate(density    = round(density),
         start.lat  = signif(start.lat, 6),
         start.long = signif(start.long, 7)) %>% 
  datatable(rownames = FALSE)
```
