# Executive Summary {-}

This report provides:  1) a detailed description of the acoustic-trawl method (ATM) used by NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center for direct assessments of the dominant coastal pelagic species (CPS; i.e.:  Pacific Sardine _Sardinops sagax_, Northern Anchovy _Engraulis mordax_, Pacific Mackerel _Scomber japonicus_, Jack Mackerel _Trachurus symmetricus_, and Pacific Herring _Clupea pallasii_ in the California Current Ecosystem off the west coast of the United States (U.S.) and sometimes portions of Canada and Baja CA, Mexico; and 2) estimates of the biomasses, distributions, and demographics of those CPS encountered in the survey area between `r survey.start` and `r survey.end` `r survey.year`. 

The core survey region, which was to be sampled by NOAA ship _`r survey.vessel.long`_ (hereafter, _`r survey.vessel`_), NOAA ship _Bell M. Shimada_ (hereafter, _Shimada_), and three wind-powered uncrewed surface vehicles (Explorer USVs; Saildrone, Inc.), spanned most of the continental shelf between `r survey.landmark.n` and `r survey.landmark.s`. Planned transects were oriented approximately perpendicular to the coast, from the shallowest navigable depth (~20 m) to either a distance of 35 nmi or to the 1,000 ftm (~1830 m) isobath, whichever is farthest. In the SCB, transects in the core region were extended to approximately 75 nmi. The survey area was designed to extend south to Punta Baja off Baja CA and north to Cape Scott off Vancouver Island, Canada, but necessarily reduced due to a loss of approximately 60% of the 81 sea days allocated aboard _`r survey.vessel`_. An additional 25 sea days were allocated aboard _Shimada_ to allow for core area sampling north of Cape Mendocino, of which 15 days were executed.   

Because sampling by _`r survey.vessel`_, _Shimada_, and the USVs in water shallower than ~20 m was deemed inefficient, unsafe, or both, fishing vessels _Long Beach Carnage_ and _Lisa Marie_ sampled CPS in the nearshore region, along 2.5 to 5 nmi-long transects spaced 5 nmi apart off the mainland coast of the U.S., between San Diego and Cape Flattery, as well as around Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands in the Southern CA Bight. In the nearshore region, the species composition and CPS length distributions were estimated using catches in daytime purse-seine sets by _Long Beach Carnage_ or _Lisa Marie_, whichever was nearest to the acoustically sampled CPS.  

The biomasses, distributions, and demographics for each species and stock are for the survey area and period, and therefore may not represent their entire population or stock. Sampling was conducted in the core and nearshore areas off Baja CA by INAPESCA, but the estimates in this report are for U.S. waters only.  

The estimated biomass of the northern stock of Northern Anchovy was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t, CV = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$biomass.cv[be.all.summ$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%). In the core region, the biomass was `r prettyNum(be.all$Biomass[be.all$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=4)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all$lower.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=4)` - `r prettyNum(be.all$upper.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t, CV = `r prettyNum(be.all$biomass.cv[be.all$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%), and in the nearshore region, biomass was `r prettyNum(be.all.ns$Biomass[be.all.ns$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.ns$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.ns$lower.ci.B[be.all.ns$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.ns$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.ns$upper.ci.B[be.all.ns$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.ns$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t, CV = `r prettyNum(be.all.ns$biomass.cv[be.all.ns$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.ns$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%), or `r prettyNum((be.all.ns$Biomass[be.all.ns$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.ns$Stock == "Northern"] / (be.all.ns$Biomass[be.all.ns$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.ns$Stock == "Northern"] + be.all$Biomass[be.all$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all$Stock == "Northern"]))*100,big.mark=",",digits=2)`% of the total biomass.

Jack Mackerel were present throughout the survey area, but were most abundant between Cape Mendocino and Fort Bragg and near the northern Channel Islands in the core and nearshore regions. The distribution of $L_F$ ranged from `r length.summ$L.min[length.summ$scientificName == 'Trachurus symmetricus']` to `r length.summ$L.max[length.summ$scientificName == 'Trachurus symmetricus']` cm with modes at 10 and 50 cm in the core region, and no clear mode in the nearshore region.

Pacific Herring were distributed from approximately Cape Flattery to Cape Mendocino, but were most abundance in the core region between Cape Flattery and Newport, and in the nearshore region between Westport and Newport, and between Cape Blanco and Cape Mendocino. The distribution of $L_F$ ranged from 8 to 23 cm, with a mode at 10 cm in the core region and at 9 and 15 cm in the nearshore region.  

The total estimated biomass of `r num2words(nrow(be.all.summ))` stocks of `r num2words(n_distinct(be.all.summ$Species))` species within the survey area was `r prettyNum(sum(be.all.summ$Biomass), big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t. Of this `r round(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Central"]/sum(be.all.summ$Biomass)*100)`% (`r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Central"], big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t) was from the central stock of Northern Anchovy.

The biomass of the central stock of Northern Anchovy, which has comprised the majority of CPS biomass since 2015, increased ~`r round((be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Central"]-biomass.pct.anch.c$biomass[biomass.pct.anch.c$year == 2022])/be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Central"],2)*100`% from `r prettyNum(biomass.pct.anch.c$biomass[biomass.pct.anch.c$year == 2022],big.mark=",",digits=5)` t estimated in summer 2022 [@Stierhoff2023b]. Jack Mackerel, which were found mostly south of Cape Mendocino, included age-0 fish, suggesting a recruitment. Most of the biomass attributed to the southern stock of Pacific Sardine was observed in the nearshore area.

# Introduction {#introduction}  

In the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), multiple coastal pelagic fish species (CPS; i.e.:  Pacific Sardine _Sardinops sagax_, Northern Anchovy _Engraulis mordax_, Jack Mackerel _Trachurus symmetricus_, Pacific Mackerel _Scomber japonicus_, and Pacific Herring _Clupea pallasii_) comprise the bulk of the forage fish assemblage. These populations, which can change by an order of magnitude within a few years, represent important prey for marine mammals, birds, and larger migratory fishes [@Field2001], and some are targets of commercial fisheries.   

During summer and fall, the northern stock of Pacific Sardine typically migrates north to feed in the productive coastal upwelling off OR, WA, and Vancouver Island [@Zwolinski2012, and references therein, **Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-distribution)**]. In synchrony, but separately, the southern stock of Pacific Sardine migrates from Northern Baja CA, Mexico to the Southern CA Bight (SCB) [@Smith2005]. The predominantly piscivorous adult Pacific and Jack Mackerels also migrate north in summer, but go farther offshore to feed [@Zwolinski2014 and references therein]. In the winter and spring, the northern stock of Pacific Sardine typically migrates south  to its spawning grounds, generally off Central and Southern CA [@Demer2012] and occasionally off OR and WA [@Lo2011]. These migrations vary in extent with population size; fish age and length; and oceanographic conditions [@Zwolinski2012]. For example, the transition zone chlorophyll front [TZCF, @Polovina2001] may delineate the offshore and southern limit of both Pacific Sardine and Pacific Mackerel habitat [e.g., @Demer2012; @Zwolinski2012], and juveniles may have nursery areas in the SCB, downstream of upwelling regions. In contrast, Northern Anchovy spawn predominantly during winter and closer to the coast where seasonal down-welling increases retention of their eggs and larvae [@Bakun1982]. Pacific Herring spawn in intertidal beach areas [@Love1996]. The northern stock of Northern Anchovy is located off WA and OR and the central stock is located off Central and Southern CA and northern Baja CA. Whether a species migrates or remains in an area depends on its reproductive and feeding behaviors, affinity to certain oceanographic or seabed habitats, and its population size.  

Acoustic-trawl method (ATM) surveys, which combine information collected with echosounders and nets, were introduced to the CCE more than 48 years ago to survey CPS off the west coast of the United States (U.S.) [@Mais1974;@Mais1977;@Smith1978]. Following a two-decade hiatus, the ATM was reintroduced in the CCE in spring 2006 to sample the then-abundant Pacific Sardine population [@Cutter2008]. Since then, this sampling effort has continued and expanded through annual or semi-annual surveys [@Zwolinski2014; @Demer2012]. Beginning in 2011, the ATM estimates of Pacific Sardine abundance, age structure, and distribution have been incorporated in the annual assessments of the northern stock [@Hill2017]. ATM estimates are used in assessments of Pacific Mackerel [@Crone2015; @Crone2019] and the central stock of Northern Anchovy [@Kuriyama2022a]. Additionally, ATM survey results have yielded estimated abundances, demographics, and distributions of epipelagic and semi-demersal fishes [e.g., @Swartzman1997; @Williams2013; @Zwolinski2014] and zooplankton [@Hewitt2000].  

This document, and references herein, describes in detail the ATM as presently used by NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) to survey the distributions and abundances of CPS and their oceanographic environments [e.g., @Cutter2008; @Demer2012; @Zwolinski2014]. In general terms, the contemporary ATM combines information from satellite-sensed oceanographic conditions, multifrequency echosounders, probe-sampled oceanographic conditions, pumped samples of fish eggs, and trawl-net catches of juvenile and adult CPS. The survey area is initially defined with consideration to the potential habitat of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine for summer surveys (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-distribution)**); or the central stock of Northern Anchovy for spring surveys, when they occur. The survey area is further expanded to encompass as much of the potential habitat as possible for other CPS present off the West Coast of the U.S. and Baja CA, as time permits.  

Along transects in the survey area, multi-frequency split-beam echosounders transmit sound pulses downward beneath the ship and receive echoes from animals and the seabed in the path of the sound waves. Measurements of sound speed and absorption from conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) probes allow accurate compensation of these echoes for propagation losses. The calibrated echo intensities, normalized to the range-dependent observational volume, provide indications of the target type and behavior [e.g., @Demer2009].  

(ref:sardine-distribution) Conceptual spring (shaded region) and summer (hashed region) distributions of potential habitat for the northern stock of Pacific Sardine along the west coasts of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The dashed and dotted lines represent, respectively, the approximate summer and spring positions of the 0.2 mg m^–3^ chlorophyll-a concentration isoline. This isoline appears to oscillate in synchrony with the transition zone chlorophyll front [TZCF, @Polovina2001] and the offshore limit of the northern stock Pacific Sardine potential habitat [@Zwolinski2011]. Mackerels are found within and on the edge of the same oceanographic  habitat [e.g., @Demer2012; @Zwolinski2012]. The TZCF may delineate the offshore and southern limit of both Pacific Sardine and Pacific Mackerel distributions, and juveniles may have nursery areas in the SCB, downstream of upwelling regions.

\newpage  

Echoes from marine organisms are a function of their body composition, shape, and size relative to the sensing-sound wavelength, and their orientation relative to the incident sound waves [@Cutter2009;@Demer2009;@Renfree2009]. Variations in echo intensity across frequencies, known as echo spectra, indicate the taxonomic groups contributing to the echoes. The CPS, with highly reflective swim bladders, create high intensity echoes of sound pulses at all echosounder frequencies [e.g., @Conti2003]. In contrast, krill, with acoustic properties closer to those of the surrounding seawater, produce lower intensity echoes, particularly at lower frequencies [e.g., @Demer2003]. The echo energy attributed to CPS, based on empirical echo spectra [@Demer2012], are apportioned to species using trawl-catch proportions [@Zwolinski2014].  

Animal densities are estimated by dividing the summed intensities attributed to a species by the length-weighted average echo intensity, i.e., the mean backscattering cross-section, from animals of that species [e.g., @Demer2012]. Transects with similar densities are grouped into post-sampling strata that mimic the natural patchiness of the target species [e.g., @Zwolinski2014]. An estimate of abundance is obtained by multiplying the average estimated density in the stratum by the stratum area [@Demer2012]. The associated sampling variance is calculated using non-parametric bootstrap of the mean transect densities. The total abundance estimate in the survey area is the sum of abundances in all strata. Similarly, the total variance estimate is the sum of the variance in each stratum.  

The primary objectives of the SWFSC’s ATM surveys are to survey the distributions and abundances of CPS, krill, and their abiotic environments in the CCE, with an emphasis on CPS. Typically, spring surveys are conducted during 25-40 days-at-sea (DAS) between March and May when they occur, and summer surveys are conducted during 50-90 DAS between June and October. In spring, the ATM surveys focus primarily on the northern stock of Pacific Sardine and the central stock of Northern Anchovy. In summer, the ATM surveys also include the northern stock of Northern Anchovy and Pacific Herring. During spring and summer, biomasses are also estimated for other CPS (e.g., Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, and Round Herring) present in the survey area.  

In `r tolower(survey.season)` `r survey.year`, the ATM survey, spanning the west coast of the U.S., was conducted by _`r survey.vessel`_ from San Diego to Cape Mendocino, and by _Shimada_ between Florence and Cape Flattery. Between Pt. Conception and Cape Flattery, along adaptive transects not sampled by _`r survey.vessel`_ or _Shimada_, three wind-powered uncrewed surface vessels (Explorer USVs; Saildrone, Inc.) conducted acoustic sampling. From San Diego to Cape Flattery, sampling from fishing vessels _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_ was used to estimate the biomasses of CPS in the nearshore regions, where sampling by _`r survey.vessel`_, _Shimada_, and USVs was not possible or safe. 

Presented here are:  1) a detailed description of the ATM used to survey CPS in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) off the west coast of the U.S. and portions of Baja CA; and 2) estimates of the abundances, biomasses, size structures, and distributions of CPS, specifically the northern and southern stocks of Pacific Sardine; the central and northern stocks of Northern Anchovy, Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Herring for the core and nearshore survey regions in which they were sampled. Additional details about the survey may be found in the survey report [@Renfree2024]. A complementary survey off Baja CA by INAPESCA used approximately the same sampling protocol. Data from that survey, including biomass estimates for CPS in those core and nearshore strata, are reported elsewhere [@Vallarta2024].  

This survey was conducted with the approval of the Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores (SRE, Diplomatic note UAN0995/2023), the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI; Authorization: EG0022023, through official letter 400./91/2023), Unidad de Planeación y Coordinación Estratégica de la Secretaría de Marina (SEMAR; Letter no AI/2301/23), Unidad Coordinadora de Asuntos Internacionales (UCAI) de la Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT; Letter UCAI/01519/2023), Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM; Letter ICML/DIR/210/2023), Unidad de Concesiones y Servicios del Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones (IFT; Letter IFT/223/UCS/DG-AUSE/3925/2023), and the Comisión Nacional de Acuacultura y Pesca (CONAPESCA; Permit: PPFE/DGPPE.-04052/100523).

# Methods {#methods}
## Sampling {#methods-data-collection}
### Design {#methods-survey-design}  

The `r tolower(survey.season)` `r survey.year` survey was conducted principally using _`r survey.vessel`_ and _Shimada_, but was augmented with acoustic sampling by three uncrewed surface vehicles (USVs,), and nearshore acoustic and purse seine sampling by _Long Beach Carnage_ and _Lisa Marie_. The sampling domain, or core region, between `r survey.landmark.n` and `r survey.landmark.s`, was defined by the conceptual distribution of potential habitat for the northern stock of Pacific Sardine in summer (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-distribution)**), but also encompassed the anticipated distributions of the southern stock of Pacific Sardine and the central and northern stocks of Northern Anchovy off the west coasts of the U.S. It also spanned portions of the Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Herring populations. East to west, the sampling domain extended from the coast to at least the 1,000 ftm (~1830 m) isobath (**Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**). Considering the expected distribution of the target species, the acceptable uncertainty in biomass estimates, and the available ship time (`r survey.das` days at sea, DAS), the principal survey objectives were to estimate the biomasses of the northern and southern stocks of Pacific Sardine and the northern and central stocks of Northern Anchovy, whose expected distributions were encompassed by the planned survey region. Secondary objectives were to estimate the population biomasses of Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, Pacific Herring, and Round Herring within the area sampled since their expected distributions extend beyond the planned survey region.   

The core region transects were perpendicular to the coast, extending from the shallowest navigable depth (~20 m) to either a distance of 35 nmi or to the 1,000 ftm isobath, whichever was farthest (**Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**). Compulsory transects were spaced 10 nmi apart in areas of historic CPS abundance (e.g., between Cape Flattery and Newport) and 20 nmi apart elsewhere. When CPS were observed within the westernmost 3 nmi of a transect, that transect and the next one to the north were extended in 5-nmi increments until no CPS were observed in the last 3 nmi of the extension, to a maximum extension of 50 nmi.  

The `r survey.das` DAS aboard _`r survey.vessel`_ were divided among three survey legs, and mid-leg personnel transfers were planned to exchange scientists, resulting in six shorter legs (e.g., Legs I.1 and I.2) between each scheduled port call. Leg I.1  and all of Leg II on _`r survey.vessel`_ were canceled due to staffing and mechanical issues aboard the ship, prompting modifications to the sampling plan. For example, all transects off Baja CA were abandoned, and Leg I.2 began sampling off San Diego, CA. Compulsory transect spacing was changed to 20 nmi throughout the survey area, and the three USVs (SD-1048, SD-1060, and SD-1096) were directed to sample groups of five adaptive interstitial transects spaced 20-nmi apart using a "leapfrog approach" between Pt. Conception and Cape Flattery (cyan lines, **Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**). However, due to delays and lost sea days, the time between acoustic sampling from USVs and trawl sampling from _`r survey.vessel`_ and _Shimada_ was often greater than 30 d, so CPS backscatter measured from USVs was not used to estimate biomass. Nine days were lost during Leg III due to mechanical issues and weather. To mitigate the loss of sea days aboard _`r survey.vessel`_, additional sampling was conducted aboard _Shimada_ during Leg IV (19 DAS), which sampled the core region between Florence and Cape Flattery.  

To estimate the abundances and biomasses of CPS between Cape Flattery and San Diego, in the nearshore area where _`r survey.vessel`_, _Shimada_, and the USVs could not efficiently or safely navigate or trawl, two fishing vessels conducted acoustic and purse-seine sampling (magenta lines, **Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**). _Long Beach Carnage_ sampled to ~5-m depth along 5-nmi-long transects spaced 5 nmi apart between San Diego and Bodega Bay, and 2.5-nmi-long transects spaced 2.5 nmi apart around Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands in the SCB. _Lisa Marie_ sampled transects to ~5-m depth, spaced 5 nmi apart between Bodega Bay and Cape Flattery (**Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**). Off OR and WA, _Lisa Marie_ conducted exploratory acoustic and purse-seine sampling beyond the 5-nmi nearshore area, but those data were excluded prior to estimating biomasses.  

(ref:survey-plan) Planned compulsory transects sampled by NOAA Ships _`r survey.vessel`_ and _Shimada_ (black lines); interstitial transects sampled by USVs (cyan lines); and nearshore transects sampled by _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_. Isobaths (light gray lines) are 50, 200, 500, and 2,000 m.

### Acoustic {#methods-acoustic-sampling}
#### Acoustic equipment {#methods-acoustic-equipment}
##### _`r survey.vessel`_  

Multi-frequency Wide-Bandwidth Transceivers (`r echo.freqs.dash[survey.vessel.primary]` Simrad EK80 WBTs; Kongsberg) were configured with split-beam transducers (Simrad `r echo.models[survey.vessel.primary]`, respectively; Kongsberg). The transducers were mounted on the bottom of a retractable keel or "centerboard" (**Fig. \@ref(fig:cb-config)**). The keel was retracted (transducers at ~`r cb.retracted`-m depth) during calibration, and extended to the intermediate position (transducers at ~`r cb.intermediate`-m depth) during the survey. Exceptions were made during shallow water operations, when the keel was retracted; or during times of heavy weather, when the keel was extended (transducers at ~`r cb.extended`-m depth) to provide extra stability and reduce the effect of weather-generated noise. In addition, acoustic data were also collected using a multibeam echosounder (Simrad ME70; Kongsberg), multibeam sonar (Simrad MS70; Kongsberg), scanning sonar (Simrad SX90; Kongsberg), acoustic Doppler current profiler and echosounder (Simrad EC150-3C, Kongsberg), and a separate ADCP (Ocean Surveyor OS75; Teledyne RD Instruments). Transducer position and motion were measured at 5 Hz using an inertial motion unit (Applanix POS-MV; Trimble).

##### _Shimada_  

Multi-frequency Wide-Bandwidth Transceivers (`r echo.freqs.dash["SH"]` Simrad EK80 WBTs; Kongsberg) were configured with split-beam transducers (Simrad `r echo.models["SH"]`, respectively; Kongsberg). The transducers were mounted on the bottom of a retractable keel or "centerboard" (**Fig. \@ref(fig:cb-config-sh)**). The keel was retracted (transducers at ~`r cb.retracted`-m depth) during calibration, and extended to the intermediate position (transducers at ~`r cb.intermediate`-m depth) during the survey. Exceptions were made during shallow water operations, when the keel was retracted; or during times of heavy weather, when the keel was extended (transducers at ~`r cb.extended`-m depth) to provide extra stability and reduce the effect of weather-generated noise. In addition, acoustic data were also collected using a multibeam echosounder (Simrad ME70; Kongsberg) and a separate ADCP (Ocean Surveyor OS75; Teledyne RD Instruments). Transducer position and motion were measured at 5 Hz using an inertial motion unit (Applanix POS-MV; Trimble).  

##### _Lisa Marie_  

On _Lisa Marie_, multi-frequency Wideband Transceivers (Simrad `r echo.freqs.dash["LM"]` EK80 WBTs; Kongsberg) were connected to the vessel's hull-mounted split-beam transducers (Simrad `r echo.models["LM"]`; Kongsberg). The transducers were at a water depth of ~4 m.  

##### _Long Beach Carnage_

On _Long Beach Carnage_, the SWFSC's multi-frequency General Purpose Transceivers (`r echo.freqs.dash["LBC"]`kHz Simrad EK60 GPTs; Kongsberg) were configured with the SWFSC's split-beam transducers (Simrad `r echo.models["LBC"]`; Kongsberg) mounted in a multi-frequency transducer array (MTA4) on the bottom of a retractable pole (**Fig. \@ref(fig:cb-config-lbc)**). The transducers were at a water depth of roughly 2 m.  

##### USVs  

On the three USVs (SD-1048, SD-1060, and SD-1096), miniature Wide-Bandwidth Transceivers (Simrad WBT-Mini; Kongsberg) were configured with gimbaled, keel-mounted, dual-frequency transducers (Simrad `r echo.models["SD"]`; Kongsberg) containing a split-beam 38-kHz transducer and single-beam 200-kHz transducer with nominally 18$^\circ$ beamwidths. The transducers were at a water depth of ~1.9 m.

#### Echosounder calibrations {#methods-echosounder-calibration}  
##### _`r survey.vessel`_

The echosounder systems aboard _`r survey.vessel`_ were calibrated on `r cal.datetime` while the vessel was docked at `r cal.loc` (`r cal.lat.dd` $^{\circ}\textrm{N}$, `r cal.lon.dd` $^{\circ}\textrm{W}$) using the standard sphere technique [@Foote1987; @Demer2015]. Each WBT was calibrated in both CW (i.e., continuous wave or narrowband mode) and FM mode (i.e., frequency modulation or broadband mode). The reference target was a `r cal.sphere`; for FM mode, additional calibrations were conducted for the 120, 200, and 333-kHz echosounders using a 25-mm WC sphere (WC25). Prior to the calibrations, temperature and salinity were measured to a depth of 10 m using a handheld probe (Pro2030, YSI) to estimate sound speeds at the transducer and sphere depths, and the time-averaged sound speed and absorption coefficients for the range between them. The theoretical target strength ($TS$; dB re 1 m^2^) of the sphere was calculated using values for the sphere, sound-pulse, and seawater properties. The sphere was positioned throughout the main lobe of each of the transducer beams using three motorized downriggers, two on one side of the vessel and one on the other. The WBTs were configured using the calibration results via the control software (Simrad EK80 `r ek80.version`; Kongsberg; **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results)**). Calibration results for WBTs in FM mode are presented in the survey report [@Renfree2024].

##### _Shimada_  

The echosounder systems aboard _Shimada_ were calibrated by the NWFSC on 9 September after completing the Integrated Ecosystem and Pacific Hake Acoustic-Trawl Survey. The calibration was conducted using the standard sphere technique [@Foote1987; @Demer2015] while the vessel was on anchor near Seattle, WA. Each WBT was calibrated in CW (i.e., continuous wave or narrowband mode) mode. The reference target was a `r cal.sphere`. Prior to the calibrations, temperature and salinity were measured to a depth of 10 m using a handheld probe (Pro2030, YSI) to estimate sound speeds at the transducer and sphere depths, and the time-averaged sound speed and absorption coefficients for the range between them. The theoretical target strength ($TS$; dB re 1 m^2^) of the sphere was calculated using values for the sphere, sound-pulse, and seawater properties. The sphere was positioned throughout the main lobe of each of the transducer beams using three motorized downriggers, two on one side of the vessel and one on the other. The WBTs were configured using the calibration results via the control software (Simrad EK80; Kongsberg; **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results-sh)**).

#### Data collection {#methods-acoustic-data-collection}  
\

On _`r survey.vessel`_ and _Shimada_, the computer clocks were synchronized with the GPS clock (UTC) using synchronization software (NetTime^[http://timesynctool.com]). The 18-kHz WBTs, operated by a separate PC from the other echosounders, were programmed to track the seabed and output the detected depth to the ship’s Scientific Computing System (SCS). The echosounders were controlled by the EK80 Adaptive Logger [EAL^[https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/science-data/ek80-adaptive-logger/], @Renfree2016]. The EAL optimizes the pulse interval based on the seabed depth, while avoiding aliased seabed echoes, and was programmed such that once an hour the echosounders would record three pings in passive mode, for obtaining estimates of the background noise level. Acoustic sampling for CPS-density estimation along the pre-determined transects was limited to daylight hours (approximately between sunrise and sunset).  

During daytime aboard _`r survey.vessel`_ and _Shimada_, measurements of volume backscattering strength ($S_v$; dB re 1 m^2^ m^-3^) and target strength ($TS$; dB re 1 m^2^), indexed by time and geographic positions provided by GPS receivers, were logged to 60 m beyond the detected seabed range or to a maximum range of 500, 500, 500, 300, and 150 m for 38, 70, 120, 200, and 333 kHz, respectively, and stored, with a `r raw.size`-GB maximum file size, in Simrad-EK80 .raw format. At nighttime, echosounders were set to FM mode to improve target strength estimation and species differentiation for CPS in the depths sampled by the the surface trawls, and logged to 100 m to reduce data volume. For each acoustic instrument, the prefix for the file names is a concatenation of the survey name (e.g.,  `r survey.name`), the operational mode (CW or FM), and the logging commencement date and time from the EK80 software. For example, file generated by the EK80 software (`r ek80.version`) for a WBT operated in CW mode is named `2207RL-CW-D20220801-T125901.raw`.  

To minimize acoustic interference, transmit pulses from all echosounders and sonars (e.g., EK80, ME70, MS70, SX90, EC150-3C, and ADCP) were triggered using a synchronization system (Simrad K-Sync; Kongsberg). The K-Sync trigger rate, and thus echosounder ping interval, was modulated by the EAL [@Renfree2016] using the seabed depth measured using the 18-kHz echosounder. During daytime, the ME70, MS70 (_`r survey.vessel`_ only), and SX90 (_`r survey.vessel`_ only) were operated continuously, but only recorded at the discretion of the acoustician during times when CPS were present. During daytime, the ADCP was operated and data were recorded continuously. At nighttime, only the EK80 and ADCP were operated. All other instruments that produce sound within the echosounder bandwidths were secured during daytime survey operations. Exceptions were made during stations (e.g., plankton sampling and fish trawling) or in shallow water when the vessel's command occasionally operated the bridge's 50- and 200-kHz echosounders (Furuno), the Doppler velocity log (SRD-500A; Sperry Marine), or both. Analyses of data from the ME70, MS70, and SX90 are not presented in this report.  

On _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_, the EAL was used to control the EK80 software to modulate the echosounder recording ranges and ping intervals to avoid aliased seabed echoes. When the EAL was not utilized, the EK80 software recorded to 1000 m and used the maximum ping rate. Transmit pulses from the echosounders and fishing sonars were not synchronized. Therefore, the latter was secured during daytime acoustic transects.  

On the USVs, the echosounders were programmed to transmit CW pulses to different ranges during daytime, dependent on the seabed depth. For deeper seabed depths, the ping interval was 2 s and the 38 and 200-kHz echosounders recorded to 1000 and 400 m, respectively. For shallower depths, the ping interval was 1 s and both echosounders recorded to 250 m. Once an hour, the echosounders operated in passive mode and recorded data from three pings to obtain estimates of the background noise levels. At night, the echosounders were programmed to transmit FM pulses and record backscatter to 100 m range.

### Oceanographic {#methods-oceanographic-sampling}
#### Conductivity and temperature versus depth (CTD) {#methods-ctd-sampling}  
\
Conductivity and temperature were measured versus depth to `r ctd.cast.depth` m (or to within ~10 m of the shallower than `r ctd.cast.depth` m) with calibrated sensors on a CTD rosette (Model SBE911+, Seabird) or underway probe [UnderwayCTD (UCTD); Oceanscience] cast from the vessel. At least one cast was planned along each acoustic transect. These data were used to calculate the harmonic mean sound speed [@Demer2015] for estimating ranges to the sound scatterers, and frequency-specific sound absorption coefficients for compensating signal attenuation of the sound pulse between the transducer and scatterers [@Simmonds2005] (see **Section \@ref(methods-sound-calcs)**).  

#### Scientific Computer System {#methods-scs-sampling}  
\
While underway, information about the position and direction (e.g., latitude, longitude, speed, course over ground, and heading), weather (air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and barometric pressure), and sea-surface oceanography (e.g., temperature, salinity, and fluorescence) were measured continuously and logged using _`r survey.vessel`_ and _Shimada_'s Scientific Computer System (SCS). During and after the survey, data from a subset of these sensors, logged with a standardized format at 1-min resolution, are available on the internet via NOAA's ERDDAP data server^[`r paste0(erddap.url, erddap.vessel,".html")`] ^[http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/fsuNoaaShipWTEDnrt.html].  

###  Fish-eggs {#methods-cufes-sampling}  

On _`r survey.vessel`_, fish eggs were sampled during the day using a continuous underway fish egg sampler [CUFES, @Checkley1997], which collects water and plankton at a rate of ~640 l min^-1^ from an intake at ~3-m depth on the hull of the ship. The particles in the sampled water were sieved by a 505-$\mu$m mesh. Pacific Sardine, Northern Anchovy, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Hake (_Merluccius productus_) eggs were identified to species, counted, and logged. Eggs from other species (e.g., Pacific Mackerel and flatfishes) were also counted and logged as "other fish eggs." Typically, the duration of each CUFES sample was 30 min, corresponding to a distance of 5 nmi at a speed of 10 kn. Because the durations of the early egg stages are short (i.e., less than 3 d) for most fish species, the egg distributions inferred from CUFES indicated the presence of actively spawning fish, and were used in combination with CPS echoes to select trawl locations.  

### Species and Demographics {#methods-trawl-sampling}  

The net catches provide information about species composition, lengths, weights and ages of CPS sampled acoustically during the day. Nighttime trawls were conducted to sample the fish dispersed in the upper ~15 m of the sea surface, because after sunset, schools of CPS and other fish tend to ascend and disperse and are less likely to avoid a trawl net [@Mais1977]. Daytime purse-seine nets were set nearshore to sample CPS schools where their depth is constrained by the seabed and their vision is obscured by turbidity due to primary production and suspended particulates.  

#### Trawl gear {#methods-trawl-gear}  
##### _`r survey.vessel`_ and _Shimada_

A Nordic 264 rope trawl (NET Systems, Bainbridge Island, WA; **Figs. \@ref(fig:trawl-diagram)a,b**), was towed at the surface for 45 min at a speed of 3.5-4.5 kn. The net has a rectangular opening with an area of approximately 300 m^2^ (~15-m tall x 20-m wide), a throat with variable-sized mesh and a "marine mammal excluder device" to prevent the capture of large animals, such as dolphins, turtles, or sharks while retaining target species [@Dotson2010], and an 8-mm square-mesh cod-end liner (to retain a large range of animal sizes). The trawl doors were foam-filled and the trawl headrope was lined with floats so the trawl towed at the surface. Temperature-depth recorders (TDRs; RBRduet^3^ T.D., RBR) were attached to the kite and footrope to evaluate trawl performance (**Fig. \@ref(fig:tdr-example)**).  

#### Purse-seine gear {#methods-seine-sampling}  
##### _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_  

_Lisa Marie_ used an approximately 440-m-long and 40-m-deep net with 17-mm-wide mesh (A. Blair, pers. comm.). _Long Beach Carnage_ used an approximately 200-m-long and 27-m-deep net with 17-mm-wide mesh; a small section on the back end of the net had 25-mm-wide mesh (R. Ashley, pers. comm.). Specimens collected by _Lisa Marie_ were processed aboard the vessel by the WA Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) and specimens collected aboard _Long Beach Carnage_ were processed ashore by the CA Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW).

#### Sampling locations {#methods-trawl-locations}  
##### _`r survey.vessel`_ and _Shimada_ {#methods-trawl-locations-lasker}  

Up to three nighttime (i.e., 30 min after sunset to 30 min before sunrise) surface trawls, typically spaced at least 10-nmi apart, were conducted in areas where echoes from putative CPS schools were observed earlier that day. Trawl locations were selected using one or more of the following criteria, in descending priority: CPS schools in echograms that day; CPS eggs in CUFES that day; and the trawl locations and catches during the previous night. Each evening, trawl locations were selected by an acoustician, who monitored CPS echoes, and a biologist, who measured the densities of CPS eggs in the CUFES. The locations were provided to the watch officers who charted the proposed trawl sites.  

If no CPS echoes or CPS eggs were observed along a transect that day, the trawls were alternately placed nearshore one night and offshore the next night, with consideration given to the seabed depth and the modeled distribution of CPS habitat. Each morning, after the last trawl or 30 min prior to sunrise, _`r survey.vessel`_ and _Shimada_ resumed sampling at the location where the acoustic sampling stopped the previous day.  

##### _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_ {#methods-seine-locations}  

On _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_, as many as three purse-seine sets were conducted each day, including evenings. For each set, three dip-net samples, were collected, spatially separated as much as possible.  

#### Sample processing {#methods-trawl-processing}  
##### _`r survey.vessel`_  

If the total volume of the trawl catch was five 35-l baskets (~175 l) or less, all target species were separated from the catch, sorted by species, weighed, and enumerated. If the volume of the entire catch was more than five baskets, a five-basket random subsample that included non-target species was collected, sorted by species, weighed, and enumerated; the remainder of the total catch was weighed. In these cases, the weight of the entire catch was calculated as the sum of the subsample and remainder weights. The weight of the $e$-th species in the total catch ($C_{T,e}$) was obtained by summing the catch weight of the respective species in the subsample ($C_{S,e}$) and the corresponding catch in the remainder ($C_{R,e}$), which was calculated as:  

\begin{equation}
C_{R,e} = C_R*P_{w,e}\text{,}
(\#eq:remainder-catch-weight)
\end{equation}

where $P_{w,e} = C_{S,e}/\sum_1^sC_{S,e}$, is the proportion in weight of the $e$-th species in the subsample. The number of specimens of the $e$-th species in the total catch ($N_{T,e}$) was estimated by:  

\begin{equation}
N_{T,e} = \frac{C_{T,e}}{\overline{w}_e}\text{,}
(\#eq:number-specimens-catch)
\end{equation}

where $\overline{w}_e$ is the mean weight of the $e$-th species in the subsample. For Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy with 75 specimens or less, individual measurements of standard length ($L_S$) in mm and weight ($w$) in g were recorded. For Jack Mackerel, Pacific Mackerel, and Pacific Herring with 50 specimens or less, individual measurements of fork length ($L_F$) and $w$ were recorded. In addition, sex and maturity were recorded for up to 75 Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy and up to 25 Jack and Pacific Mackerel. Ovaries were preserved for up to 10 specimens of each CPS species except Pacific Herring. Fin clips were removed from 50 Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy specimens from seven geographic zones (with boundaries at the Columbia River, Cape Mendocino, San Francisco Bay, Point Conception, San Diego, and San Quentin, Baja CA) and preserved in ethanol for genetic analysis. Otoliths were removed from all 50 Pacific Sardine in the subsample; for other CPS species except Pacific Herring, 25 otoliths were removed as equally as possible from the range of sizes present. The combined catches in up to three trawls per night (i.e., trawl cluster) were used to estimate the proportions of species contributing to the nearest samples of acoustic backscatter.  

##### _Lisa Marie_ {#methods-seine-processing-lm}  

For each dip-net sample, all specimens were sorted, weighed, and counted to provide a combined weight and count for each. Next, all three dip-net samples were combined and up to 50 specimens of each CPS species were randomly sampled to provide a combined weight for each set. Length (mm), $L_S$ for Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy and $L_F$ for all others, and weight (g) were measured for up to 50 randomly selected specimens of each species. Otoliths were extracted, macroscopic maturity stage was determined visually, and gonads were collected and preserved from female specimens. For some specimens, fin clips were collected and stored in blotter paper for later genetic analysis.  

##### _Long Beach Carnage_ {#methods-seine-processing-lbc}  

For each dip-net sample, all specimens were sorted, weighed, and counted to provide a combined weight and count for each, and as many as 20 fish of each CPS species were chosen randomly throughout the sample, and combined for a random sample of 50 fish collected throughout the catch. The fish were frozen for later analysis by CDFW biologists, yielding measures of individual fish and total sample weights (g); length (mm), $L_S$ for Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy and $L_F$ for all others;  maturity; and otolith-derived ages. No female gonad samples were analyzed.

#### Quality Assurance and Quality Control {#methods-trawl-qaqc}  

At sea, trawl data were entered into a database (Microsoft Access). During and following the survey, data were further scrutinized and verified, or corrected. Missing length ($L_{miss}$) and weight ($W_{miss}$) measurements were estimated as $W_{miss} = \beta_0{L}^{\beta_1}$ and $L_{miss} = (W/\beta_0)^{(1/\beta_1)}$, respectively, where values for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are species- and season-specific parameters of the length-versus-weight relationships described in Palance et al. [@Palance2019]. To identify measurement or data-entry errors, length and weight data were graphically compared (**Fig.** \@ref(fig:lw-plot)) to measurements from previous surveys and models of season-specific length-versus-weight from previous surveys [@Palance2019]. Outliers were flagged, reviewed by the trawl team, and corrected if errors were identified; else, catch and specimen data were used as-is. Catch data were removed from aborted trawl hauls, or hauls otherwise deemed unacceptable.

## Data processing {#methods-data-processing}  
### Acoustic and oceanographic data {#methods-acoustic-processing}  

The calibrated echosounder data from each transect were processed using commercial software ([Echoview](https://www.echoview.com/) `r ev.version`; Echoview Software Pty Ltd.) and estimates of the sound speed and absorption coefficient calculated with contemporaneous data from CTD probes cast while stationary or underway (UCTD, see **Section \@ref(methods-ctd-sampling)**). Data collected along the daytime transects at speeds $\geq$ 5 kn were used to estimate CPS densities. Nighttime acoustic data were not used for biomass estimations because they are assumed to be negatively biased due to diel-vertical migration and disaggregation of the target species’ schools [@Cutter2008].  

### Sound speed and absorption calculation {#methods-sound-calcs}  

Pressure measured in CTD casts was used to derived depth samples, averaged in 1-m bins. Sound speed in each bin ($c_{w,i}$, m s^-1^) was estimated from the average salinity, density, and pH [if measured, else pH = 8; @Chen1977; @Seabird2013]. The harmonic sound speed in the water column ($\overline{c}_w$, m s^-1^) was calculated over the upper 70 m as:  

\begin{equation}
\overline{c}_w = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \Delta r_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \Delta r_i/c_{w,i}}\text{,}
(\#eq:time-avg-sound-speed)
\end{equation}

where $\Delta r$ is the depth of increment $i$ [@Seabird2013]. Measurements of seawater temperature ($t_w$, $^{\circ}\textrm{C}$), salinity ($s_w$, psu), depth, pH, and $\overline{c}_w$ are also used to calculate the mean absorption coefficients ($\overline{\alpha}_a$, dB m^-1^) over species-specific portion of the profile, using equations in Francois and Garrison [-@Francois1982a], Ainslie and McColm [-@Ainslie1998], and Doonan et al. [-@Doonan2003]. Both $\overline{c}_w$ and $\overline{\alpha}_a$ are later used to estimate ranges to the sound scatterers to compensate the echo signal for spherical spreading and attenuation during propagation of the sound pulse from the transducer to the scatterer range and back [@Simmonds2005]. The CTD rosette, when cast, also provides measures of fluorescence and dissolved oxygen concentration versus depth, which may be used to estimate the vertical dimension of Pacific Sardine potential habitat [@Zwolinski2011], particularly the depth of the upper-mixed layer where most epipelagic CPS reside. The latter information is used to inform echo classification (see **Section \@ref(methods-echo-classification)**).  

### Echo classification {#methods-echo-classification}  

Echoes from schooling CPS and plankton (**Figs. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)a,d**) were identified using a semi-automated data processing algorithm implemented using Echoview software (`r ev.version`; Echoview Software Pty Ltd). The filters and thresholds were based on a subsample of echoes from randomly selected CPS schools. The aim of the filter criteria is to retain at least 95% of the noise-free backscatter from CPS while rejecting at least 95% of the non-CPS backscatter (**Fig. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)**). Data from _`r survey.vessel`_, _Shimada_, _Lisa Marie_, and _Long Beach Carnage_ were processed using the following steps:  

1. Match geometry of all $S_v$ variables to the 38-kHz $S_v$;
2. Remove passive-mode pings;
3. Estimate and subtract background noise using the background noise removal function [@DeRobertis2007] in Echoview (**Figs. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)b,e**);
4. Average the noise-free $S_v$ echograms using non-overlapping 11-sample by 3-ping bins;
5. Expand the averaged, noise-reduced _S~v~_ echograms with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation;
6. For each pixel, compute: $S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$, $S_{v,\mathrm{120kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$, and $S_{v,\mathrm{70kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$;
7. Create a Boolean echogram for $S_v$ differences in the CPS range: $-13.85 < S_{v,\mathrm{70kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 9.89 \text{ and} -13.5 < S_{v,\mathrm{120kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 9.37 \text{ and} -13.51 < S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 12.53$;
8. Compute the 120- and 200-kHz Variance-to-Mean Ratios [$VMR_{\mathrm{120kHz}}$ and $VMR_{\mathrm{200kHz}}$, respectively, @Demer2009a] using the difference between noise-filtered $S_v$ (Step 3) and averaged $S_v$ (Step 4);
9. Expand the $VMR_{\mathrm{120kHz}}$ and $VMR_{\mathrm{200kHz}}$ echograms with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation;
10. Create a Boolean echogram based on the $VMR$s in the CPS range: $VMR_{\mathrm{120kHz}}$ > -65 dB and $VMR_{\mathrm{200kHz}}$ > -65 dB. Diffuse backscattering layers have low $VMR$ [@Zwolinski2010] whereas fish schools have high $VMR$ [@Demer2009a];
11. Intersect the two Boolean echograms to create an echogram with "TRUE" samples for candidate CPS schools and "FALSE" elsewhere;
12. Mask the noise-reduced echograms using the CPS Boolean echogram (**Figs. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)c,f**);
13. Create an integration-start line `r int.start` m below the transducer (~10 m depth);
14. Create an integration-stop line `r adz.range` m above the estimated seabed [@Demer2009a], or to the maximum logging range (e.g., `r int.stop` m), whichever is shallowest;
15. Set the minimum $S_v$ threshold to -60 dB (corresponding to a density of approximately three 20-cm-long Pacific Sardine per 100 m^3^);
16. Integrate the volume backscattering coefficients ($s_V$, m^2^ m^-3^) attributed to CPS over 5-m depths and averaged over 100-m distances;
17. Output the resulting nautical area scattering coefficients ($s_A$; m^2^ nmi^-2^) and associated information from each transect and frequency to comma-delimited text (.csv) files.  

Data from the USVs were processed using the following steps:

1. Match geometry of the $S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}$ to the $S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$;
2. Remove passive-mode pings;
3. Perform Steps 3-5 from processing steps above;
4. For each pixel, compute: $S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$;
5. Create a Boolean echogram for $S_v$ differences in the CPS range: $-13.51 < S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 12.53$
6. Perform Steps 8-9 from processing steps above;
7. Create a Boolean echogram mask using $VMR$ > -57 dB;
8. Performs Steps 11-17 from processing steps above.    

When necessary, the start and stop integration lines were manually edited to exclude reverberation due to bubbles, to include the entirety of shallow CPS aggregations, or to exclude seabed echoes. Also, echoes from putative rockfish schools were excluded based on their aggregation shapes and proximity to the rocky seabed.  

### Removal of non-CPS backscatter {#methods-backscatter-removal}  

In addition to echoes from target CPS, echoes may also be present from other pelagic fish species (Pacific Saury, _Cololabis saira_), or semi-demersal fish such as Pacific Hake and rockfishes ($Sebastes$ spp.). When analyzing the acoustic-survey data, it was therefore necessary to filter "acoustic by-catch," i.e., backscatter not from the target species. To exclude echoes from mid-water, demersal, and benthic fishes, echograms were visually examined to exclude fish echoes where the seabed was hard and rugose, or where diffuse schools are observed offshore either near the surface or deeper than ~250 m (**Fig. \@ref(fig:extract-nasc)**). In areas dominated by Pacific Herring, for example off Vancouver Island, backscatter was integrated to a maximum depth of 75 m.  

(ref:ev-filtering-example) Two examples of echograms depicting CPS schools (red) and plankton aggregations (blue and green) at 38 kHz (top) and 120 kHz (bottom). Example data processing steps include the original echogram (a, d), after noise subtraction and bin-averaging (b, e), and after filtering to retain only putative CPS echoes (c, f).

In this example, the upper (blue) and lower lines (green) indicate boundaries within which echoes were retained. Where the lower boundary was deeper than the seabed (black line), echoes above the seabed were retained. Echoes from deep, bottom-dwelling schools of non-CPS fishes with swimbladders, and from diffuse scatterers near the surface were excluded. The proximity of the echoes to the seabed was also used to define the lower limit for vertical integration.

```{r extract-nasc,fig.cap='(ref:extract-nasc)',out.width='6.5in',fig.pos='H'}

In this example, temperature profiles indicate an ~25 m-deep mixed-layer above an ~20-30 m thermocline, so the 11 $^{\circ}\textrm{C}$ isotherm (bold, blue line; right panel) was used to remove echoes from deeper, bottom-dwelling schools of non-CPS fishes with swimbladders. The proximity of the echoes to the seabed (bold, red line; right panel) was also used to define the lower limit for vertical integration.
```  

### Quality Assurance and Quality Control {#methods-acoustics-qaqc}  

The largest 38-kHz integrated backscattering coefficients ($s_A$, m^2^ nmi^-2^) were graphically examined to identify potential errors in the integrated data (e.g.,  when a portion of the seabed was accidentally integrated, not shown). If found, errors were corrected and data were re-integrated prior to use for biomass estimation.  

### Echo integral partitioning and acoustic inversion {#methods-echointegration}  

For fishes with swimbladders, the acoustic backscattering cross-section of an individual ($\sigma_{bs}$, m^2^) depends on many factors but mostly on the acoustic wavelength and the swimbladder size and orientation relative to the incident sound pulse. For echosounder sampling conducted in this survey, $\sigma_{bs}$ is a function of the dorsal-surface area of the swimbladder and was approximated by a function of fish length ($L$), i.e.:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{bs} = 10^{\frac{m\,\log_{10}(L)+b}{10}}\text{,}
(\#eq:sigma-bs)
\end{equation}

where $m$ and $b$ are frequency and species-specific parameters that are obtained theoretically or experimentally (see references below). $TS$, a logarithmic representation of $\sigma_{bs}$, is defined as:

\begin{equation}
TS = 10\,\log_{10}(\sigma_{bs}) = m\,\log_{10}(L) + b\text{.}
(\#eq:ts-sigma-bs-equation)
\end{equation}

$TS$ has units of dB re 1 m^2^ if defined for an individual, or dB re 1 m^2^ kg^-1^ if defined by weight. The following equations for $TS_{38\mathrm{kHz}}$, were used in this analysis:  

\begin{equation}
TS_{\mathrm{38kHz}} = -14.90 \times \log_{10} (L_T) - 13.21 \text{, for Pacific Sardine;}
(\#eq:tl-ts-sardine)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
TS_{\mathrm{38kHz}} = -11.97 \times \log_{10} (L_T) - 11.58561 \text{, for Pacific and Round Herrings;}
(\#eq:tl-ts-herring)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
TS_{\mathrm{38kHz}} = -13.87 \times \log_{10} (L_T) - 11.797 \text{, for Northern Anchovy; and}
(\#eq:tl-ts-anchovy)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
TS_{\mathrm{38kHz}} = -15.44 \times \log_{10} (L_T) - 7.75 \text{, for Pacific and Jack Mackerels,}
(\#eq:tl-ts-mackerel)
\end{equation}

where the units for total length ($L_T$) is cm and $TS$ is dB re 1 m^2^ kg^-1^.  

Equations \@ref(eq:tl-ts-sardine) and \@ref(eq:tl-ts-mackerel) were derived from echosounder measurements of $\sigma_{bs}$ for in situ fish and measures of $L_T$ and $W$ from concomitant catches of South American Pilchard (_Sardinops ocellatus_) and Horse Mackerel (_Trachurus trachurus_) off South Africa [@Barange1996]. Because mackerels have similar $TS$ [@Pena2008], Equation \@ref(eq:tl-ts-mackerel) is used for both Pacific and Jack Mackerels. For Pacific Herring and Round Herring, Equation \@ref(eq:tl-ts-herring) was derived from that of Thomas et al. [-@Thomas2002] measured at 120 kHz with the following modifications: 1) the intercept used here was calculated as the average intercept of Thomas et al.'s spring and fall regressions; 2) the intercept was compensated for swimbladder compression after Zhao et al. [-@Zhao2008] using the average depth for Pacific Herring of 44 m; 3) the intercept was increased by 2.98 dB to account for the change of frequency from 120 to 38 kHz [@Saunders2012]. For Northern Anchovy, Equation \@ref(eq:tl-ts-anchovy) was derived from that of Kang et al. [-@Kang2009], after compensation of the swimbladder volume [@Ona2003;@Zhao2008] for the average depth of Northern Anchovy observed in summer 2016 [19 m, @Zwolinski2017].  

To calculate $TS_{38\mathrm{kHz}}$, $L_T$ was estimated from measurements of $L_S$ or $L_F$ using linear relationships between length and weight derived from specimens collected in the CCE [@Palance2019]: for Pacific Sardine, $L_T = 0.3574 + 1.149L_S$; for Northern Anchovy, $L_T = 0.2056 + 1.1646 L_S$; for Pacific Mackerel, $L_T = 0.2994 + 1.092 L_F$; for Jack Mackerel $L_T = 0.7295 + 1.078 L_F$; and for Pacific Herring $L_T = -0.105 + 1.2 L_F$. Since a conversion does not exist for Round Herring, the equation for Pacific Herring was used to estimate $L_T$.  

The proportions of species in a trawl cluster were considered representative of the proportions of species in the vicinity of the cluster. Therefore, the proportion of the echo-integral from the $e$-th species ($P_e$) in an ensemble of $s$ species can be calculated from the species catches $N_1, N_2,..., N_s$ and the respective average backscattering cross-sections $\sigma_{bs_1}, \sigma_{bs_2},...,\sigma_{bs_s}$ [@Nakken1975]. The acoustic proportion for the $e$-th species in the $a$-th trawl ($P_{ae}$) is:

\begin{equation}
P_{ae} = \frac{N_{ae} \times \overline{w}_{ae} \times \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae}}{\sum_{e=1}^{s_a} (N_{ae} \times \overline{w}_{ae} \times \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae})}\text{, }
(\#eq:acoustic-prop-spp)
\end{equation}

where $\overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae}$ is the arithmetic counterpart of the average target strength ($\overline{TS}_{ae}$) for all $n_{ae}$ individuals of species $e$ in the random sample of trawl $a$:  

\begin{equation}
\overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n_{ae}}10^{(TS_i/10)}}{n_{ae}}\text{, }
(\#eq:avg-ts-all-spp)
\end{equation}

and $\overline{w}_{ae}$ is the average weight: $\overline{w}_{ae} = \sum_{i=1}^{n_{ae}}{w_{aei}}/{n_{ae}}$. The total number of individuals of species $e$ in a trawl $a$ ($N_{ae}$) is obtained by: $N_{ae}=\frac{n_{ae}}{w_{s,ae}} \times w_{t,ae}$, where $w_{s,ae}$ is the weight of the $n_{ae}$ individuals sampled randomly, and $w_{t,ae}$ is the total weight of the respective species' catch.  

The trawls within a cluster were combined to reduce sampling variability (see **Section \@ref(methods-trawl-clustering)**), and the number of individuals caught from the $e$-th species in a cluster $g$ ($N_{ge}$) was obtained by summing the catches across the $h$ trawls in the cluster: $N_{ge}=\sum_{a=1}^{h_g}N_{ae}$. The backscattering cross-section for species $e$ in the $g$-th cluster with $a$ trawls is then given by:  

\begin{equation}
\overline{\sigma}_{bs,ge}=\frac{\sum_{a=1}^{h_g} N_{ae} \times \overline{w}_{ae} \times \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae}}{\sum_{a=1}^{s_g} N_{ae} \times \overline{w}_{ae}}\text{, }
(\#eq:sigma-spp-j)
\end{equation}

where:  

\begin{equation}
\overline{w}_{ge} = \frac{\sum_{a=1}^{h_g} N_{ae} \times \overline{w}_{ae}}{\sum_{a=1}^{h_g} N_{ae}}\text{, }
(\#eq:w-spp-j)
\end{equation}

and the proportion ($P_{ge}$) is;

\begin{equation}
P_{ge} = \frac{N_{ge} \times \overline{w}_{ge} \times \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae}}{\sum_{e=1}^{s}(N_{ge} \times \overline{w}_{ge} \times \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ge})}\text{.}
(\#eq:prop-spp-j)
\end{equation}  

### Trawl clustering and species proportion {#methods-trawl-clustering}  

Trawls that occurred on the same night were assigned to a trawl cluster. Biomass densities ($\rho$) were calculated for 100-m transect intervals by dividing the integrated area-backscatter coefficients for each CPS species by the mean backscattering cross-sectional area [@MacLennan2002] estimated in the trawl cluster nearest in space. Survey data were post-stratified to account for spatial heterogeneity in sampling effort and biomass density in a similar way to that performed for Pacific Sardine [@Zwolinski2016].  

For a generic 100-m long acoustic interval, the area-backscattering coefficient for species $e$: $s_{A,e} = s_{A,cps} \times P_{ge}$, where $P_{ge}$ is the species acoustic proportion of the nearest trawl cluster (Equation \@ref(eq:prop-spp-j)), was used to estimate the biomass density ($\rho_{w,e}$) [@MacLennan2002; @Simmonds2005] for every 100-m interval, using the size and species composition of the nearest (space and time) trawl cluster (**Fig. \@ref(fig:trawl-cluster-map)**):

\begin{equation}
\rho_{w,e} = \frac{s_{A,e}}{4\pi\overline{\sigma}_{bs,e}}\text{.}
(\#eq:biomass-density)
\end{equation}  

The biomass densities were converted to numerical densities using: $\rho_{n,e}=\rho_{w,e}/\overline{w}_e$, where $\overline{w}_e$ is the corresponding mean weight. Also, for each acoustic interval, the biomass or numeric densities are partitioned into length classes according to the species' length distribution in the respective trawl cluster.

Black points in panel b) indicate trawl clusters or purse-seine sets with no CPS present in the catch.

## Data analysis {#methods-data-analysis}
### Post-stratification {#methods-post-stratification}  

The transects were sampling units [@Simmonds1996]. Because each species does not generally span the entire survey area [@Zwolinski2014; @Demer2017], the sampling domain was stratified for each species and stock. Strata were defined by uniform transect spacing (sampling intensity) and either presences (positive densities and potentially structural zeros) or absences (real zeros) of species biomass. Each stratum has: 1) at least three transects, with approximately equal spacing, 2) fewer than three consecutive transects with zero-biomass density, and 3) bounding transects with zero-biomass density (**Fig. \@ref(fig:tx-biom-dens)**). This approach tracks stock patchiness and creates statistically-independent, stationary, post-sampling strata [@Johannesson1983; @Simmonds1992]. For Northern Anchovy, we define the separation between the northern and central stock at `r names(stock.break.anch)` (`r round(stock.break.anch,1)` $^{\circ}\textrm{N}$). For Pacific Sardine, the northern and southern stocks present in the survey area [@Hill2014; @Felix-Uraga2004; @Felix-Uraga2005; @Garcia-Morales2012] were separated using the revised model of Pacific Sardine potential habitat [@Zwolinski2023c] during the survey (**Figs. \@ref(fig:transects-and-habitat-core)** and **\@ref(fig:transects-and-habitat-nearshore)**). This separation is further supported by different distributions of $L_S$ and a break in the distribution of Pacific Sardine biomass, which, in this survey, coincided geographically with `r names(stock.break.sar)` (`r round(stock.break.sar, 1)` $^{\circ}\textrm{N}$, **Fig. \@ref(fig:tx-biom-dens)**).

### Biomass and sampling precision estimation {#methods-biomass-and-precision}  

For each stratum and stock, the biomass ($\hat{B}$; kg) of each species was estimated by: 

\begin{equation}
\hat{B} = A \times \hat{D}\text{, }
(\#eq:biomass-mean)
\end{equation}

where $A$ is the stratum area (nmi^2^) and $\hat{D}$ is the estimated mean biomass density (kg nmi^-2^):

\begin{equation}
\hat{D} = \frac{\sum_{l=1}^{k}\overline{\rho}_{w,l} c_l}{\sum_{l=1}^{k}c_l}\text{, }
(\#eq:biomass-mean-density)
\end{equation}

where $\overline{\rho}_{w,l}$ is the mean biomass density of the species on transect $l$, $c_l$ is the transect length, and $k$ is the total number of transects. The variance of $\hat{B}$ is a function of the variability of the transect-mean densities and associated lengths. Treating transects as replicate samples of the underlying population [@Simmonds1996], the variance was calculated using bootstrap resampling [@Efron1981] based on transects as sampling units. Provided that each stratum has independent and identically-distributed transect means (i.e., densities on nearby transects are not correlated, and they share the same statistical distribution), bootstrap or other random-sampling estimators provide unbiased estimates of variance.

The 95% confidence intervals (CI~95%~) for the mean biomass densities ($\hat{D}$) were estimated as the 0.025 and 0.975 percentiles of the distribution of `r boot.num` bootstrap survey-mean biomass densities. Coefficient of variation (CV, %) values were obtained by dividing the bootstrapped standard error by the mean estimate [@Efron1981]. Total biomass in the survey area was estimated as the sum of the biomasses in each stratum, and the associated sampling variance was calculated as the sum of the variances across strata.  

### Abundance- and biomass-at-length estimation {#methods-abundance-at-length}  

The numerical densities by length class (**Section \@ref(methods-trawl-clustering)**) were averaged for each stratum in a similar way for that used for biomass (Equation \@ref(eq:biomass-mean-density)), and multiplied by the stratum area to obtain abundance per length class.  

### Percent biomass per cluster contribution {#methods-cluster-biomass-density}  

The percent contribution of each cluster to the estimated abundance in a stratum (**Appendix \@ref(appendix-cluster-length-percent)**) was calculated as:  

\begin{equation}
\frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^{l}\overline{\rho}_{ci}}{\Sigma_{c=1}^{C}\Sigma_{i=1}^{l}\overline{\rho}_{ci}}{\text{,}}
(\#eq:pct-acoustic-biomass)
\end{equation}

where $\overline{\rho}_{ci}$ is the numerical density in interval $i$ represented by the nearest trawl cluster $c$.

The `r tolower(survey.season)` `r survey.year` survey spanned the area from Cape Flattery to the U.S.-Mexico border between `r format(ymd(erddap.survey.start),"%d %B")` and `r format(ymd(erddap.survey.end.sh),"%d %B %Y")`, and included most of the potential habitat for the northern stock of Pacific Sardine at the time of the survey^[https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/sardine_habitat_modis.html]. In the core survey region that spanned this area (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)**), _`r survey.vessel`_ (`r das.rl` days at sea, DAS) and _Shimada_ (`r das.sh` DAS) sampled `r nrow(nasc.summ)` east-west transects totaling `r prettyNum(sum(nasc.summ$distance), digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` nmi. Catches from a total of `r nrow(haul)` nighttime surface trawls were combined into `r n_distinct(haul$cluster)` trawl clusters. In the core area, one to `r num2words(max(as.numeric(be$Stratum), na.rm = TRUE))` post-survey strata were defined by their transect spacing and the densities of echoes attributed to each species.  

The nearshore region spanned an area from approximately Cape Flattery to San Diego, including around Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands. _Lisa Marie_ (`r das.lm` DAS) surveyed from approximately Cape Flattery, WA to Bodega Bay with `r nrow(nasc.summ.lm.ns)` east-west transects totaling `r sprintf("%.0f",sum(nasc.summ.lm.ns$distance))` nmi and `r set.summ$n[set.summ$vessel.name == "LM"]` purse-seine sets. _Long Beach Carnage_ (`r das.lbc` DAS) surveyed from approximately Bodega Bay to San Diego, and around the Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands, with `r nrow(nasc.summ.lbc.ns)` east-west transects totaling `r sprintf("%.0f",sum(nasc.summ.lbc.ns$distance))` nmi and `r set.summ$n[set.summ$vessel.name == "LBC"]` purse-seine sets (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lbc)**). In the nearshore area, one to `r num2words(max(as.numeric(be.ns$Stratum),na.rm = T))` post-survey strata were defined by their transect spacing and the biomass densities.  

Biomasses and abundances were estimated for each species in both the core and nearshore survey areas. The total biomass for each stock within the survey region was estimated as the sum of its biomasses in the core and nearshore areas.  

**Leg I**  

*I.1*

>Leg I.1 on _`r survey.vessel`_ was canceled due to staffing shortages and a seawater leak.

*I.2*

>On 17 July, after a 14-d delay, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from the 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego, CA at ~2000 (all times GMT). Prior to the transit, a calibration for the Simrad EC150-3C ADCP was conducted northwest of the sea buoy outside San Diego Bay (32.6598 N,  117.3833 W). Due to the departure delays, sampling off Baja California was abandoned, with the survey commencing on 18 July along transect 033 off Imperial Beach, CA. On the evening of 22 July, a scientist and member of the deck crew were embarked using _`r survey.vessel`_’s small boat at Dana Point Harbor. On 29 July, _`r survey.vessel`_ ceased acoustic sampling after completing the nearshore portion of transect 057 off Morro Bay, CA. At ~1300 on 30 July, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at Pier 30/32 in San Francisco, CA to complete Leg I.

*Nearshore*

>_Long Beach Carnage_ sampled nearshore transects 001 to 038, between San Diego, CA to Point Conception, CA, including around the Santa Catalina and Santa Cruz Islands, from 8 to 18 July.

>_Lisa Marie_ conducted purse seine sets for comparative catch analyses between Point Conception, CA and Monterey Bay, CA from 22 to 25 July.

>Two USVs (SD-1060 and SD-1096) sampled transects 052 to 070, from Point Conception, CA to Half Moon Bay, CA, from 21 to 30 July.

**Leg II**  

>Leg II on _`r survey.vessel`_ was canceled due to staffing shortages and cases of COVID-19.

*Nearshore*

>_Long Beach Carnage_ sampled nearshore transects 039 to 090, from Point Conception, CA to Bodega Bay, CA, from 7 to 16 August.  

>_Lisa Marie_ conducted purse seine sets for comparative catch analyses between Point Conception, CA and San Luis Obispo, CA from 6 to 8 August. Then, from 11 August to 2 September, _Lisa Marie_ sampled nearshore transects 091 to 216, from Bodega Bay, CA to Cape Flattery, WA.  

>The three USVs sampled transects 072 to 100, from Half Moon Bay, CA to Crescent City, CA, from 10 to 29 August

**Leg III** 

*III.1*

>At ~2030 on 5 September, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from 10th Avenue Marine Terminal, San Diego.  At ~2100 UTC on 6 September, an acoustic lander was deployed near Point Conception, CA at 34.43877 N, 120.54697 W.  At ~1400 on 7 September, acoustic sampling resumed along transect 057 off Morro Bay, CA. At ~0100 on 11 September, after completing acoustic transect 067, a scientist was embarked via a small boat transfer near Moss Landing, CA. On 12 September, after a crack was discovered in a freshwater anti-roll tank, an emergency trip was planned to Pier 30/32 in San Francisco, CA, with evening trawling operations en-route. However, while in transit to the first trawl location on transect 077, the S-Band RADAR unexpectedly stopped turning. As a result, the ship abandoned the planned trawls on transects 079 and 077 and began the emergency transit to San Francisco, CA. The ship moored alongside pier 30/32 at ~1400 on 13 September. On 13 and 14 September, the ship's engineers patched the crack in the anti-roll tank, and the ship's Electronics Technician worked with RADAR technicians to fix the S-Band RADAR. At ~1430 on 15 September, the ship departed San Francisco, CA, resumed daytime acoustic sampling on transect 081, then trawled that evening on transects 077 and 079. At ~0700 on 17 September, after finishing acoustic sampling on transect 089 and conducting one nighttime trawl, _`r survey.vessel`_ transited to San Francisco, CA for a mid-leg crew transfer on 18 September.

*III.2*

>At ~1800 on 21 September, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from Pier 30/32 in San Francisco, CA. On 21 September, a passive acoustic buoy, part of SWFSC's ADRIFT acoustic monitoring project, was safely recovered after its previously scheduled retrieval vessel experienced mechanical problems. During the transit, the leak in _`r survey.vessel`_'s anti-roll tank reemerged, but the decision was made to continue the survey. At ~1815 on 22 September, _`r survey.vessel`_ resumed acoustic sampling along transect 091 off Petrolia, CA. On 22 September, transects 091 and 093 were sampled acoustically and two trawls conducted that evening. With a leaking anti-roll tank and unworkable weather conditions in the forecast, it was decided to cease survey operations on 23 September and return to Newport, OR. At 1700 on 24 September, _`r survey.vessel`_ returned to the MOC-P Pier in Newport, OR to end Leg III and conclude the 2023 Summer CCE survey aboard _`r survey.vessel`_. On 24 and 25 September, survey equipment was demobilized and transferred ashore, awaiting mobilization of _Shimada_ for Leg IV.

*Nearshore*

>The three USVs sampled transects 102 to 134, from Crescent City, CA to Santiago, WA, from 5 to 30 September. This marked the end of the 2023 survey for the USVs.

**Leg IV** 

*IV.1*

>Due to inclement weather on 10 and 11 October, Leg IV.1 on _Shimada_ was delayed by two days. At ~1900 on 12 October, _Shimada_ departed from Newport, OR and commenced acoustic sampling on transect 117. Transects 121, 123, 125, and 127 were shortened to 40-nmi lengths due to weather conditions. At ~1100 on 16 October, after completing nighttime trawling, _Shimada_ transited south to transect 115 to be closer to port at Newport, OR if weather conditions deteriorated. On 16 October, after completing the third trawl outside the entrance to the Columbia River, the crew discovered that the main body of the trawl net was damaged. Due to the high sea state, the trawl net was replaced betwween Legs IV.1 and IV.2 rather than while underway. At ~2100 on 17 October, during favorable bar conditions, _Shimada_ arrived at the MOC-P pier in Newport, OR to complete Leg IV.1.

*IV.2*

>At ~1945 on 26 October, _Shimada_ departed from the MOC-P pier in Newport, OR and commenced acoustic sampling on transect 115 off Florence, OR. On 2 November, _Shimada_ ceased acoustic sampling after completing transect 141 off Cape Flattery, WA, thereby concluding the 2023 CCES Survey. _Shimada_ then transited to Anacortes, WA for demobilization, arriving at ~1800 on 3 November.  

## Acoustic backscatter {#results-backscatter-distribution} 

Acoustic backscatter ascribed to CPS was observed throughout the latitudinal range of the core survey area (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)a**), but was greatest between Fort Bragg and Monterey. Acoustic backscatter was present from the shore to the shelf break, but was generally greater closer to shore. Zero-biomass intervals were observed at the offshore end of each transect in the core region. Greater than `r cum.biomass.limit*100`% of the biomass for each species was apportioned using catch data from trawl clusters conducted within 30 nmi, except Jack Mackerel, which was within ~40 nmi (**Fig. \@ref(fig:biomass-cluster-distance)**).  

Acoustic backscatter ascribed to CPS was also observed throughout the nearshore survey area (**Figs. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lm)a** and **\@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lbc)a**), but was most prevalent in transects sampled by _Lisa Marie_ between Cape Flattery and the Columbian River, and betweeen Cape Blanco and Crescent City (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lm)a**) and along mainland transects sampled by _Long Beach Carnage_ between Bodega Bay and Santa Barbara (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lbc)a**).  

## Egg densities and distributions {#results-cufes-density}  

In 2023, CUFES sampling was only conducted from _`r survey.vessel`_ between San Diego and Cape Mendocino. Northern Anchovy eggs were predominant in positive samples collected throughout the area sampled by _`r survey.vessel`_ (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)b**). Some Jack Mackerel eggs were present off Morro Bay and around the northern Channel Islands (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)b**). Some Pacific Sardine eggs were present in samples collected in the SCB, around Santa Catalina and San Clemente Islands (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)b**).  

## Trawl catch {#results-trawl-catch}  

Trawl catches from _`r survey.vessel`_ and _Shimada_ were comprised of mostly Pacific Herring between Cape Blanco and Cape Flattery, and Northern Anchovy farther south (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**). Pacific Herring and Pacific Sardine were predominant in trawl clusters off the coasts of WA and OR. Pacific Sardine were also present in trawl clusters close to shore in the SCB. Northern Anchovy were predominant in trawl clusters south of Cape Mendocino. Jack Mackerel were present throughout the survey area, but were most abundant off the Columbia River and offshore between Cape Mendocino and San Diego (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**). Few Pacific Mackerel were collected (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**). Overall, the `r nrow(haul)` trawls and `r set.summ$n[set.summ$vessel.name == "LM"]` purse-seine sets captured a combined `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$AllCPS),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of CPS (`r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'Anchovy'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Northern Anchovy, `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'Sardine'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Sardine, `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'PacHerring'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Herring, `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'JackMack'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Jack Mackerel, and `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'PacMack'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Mackerel).  

## Purse-seine catch {#results-seine-catch}  
### _Lisa Marie_ {#results-seine-catch-lm}  

North of Cape Blanco, Pacific Herring and Pacific Sardine were predominant, by weight, in the purse-seine samples (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lm)b**). However, most of the purse-seine samples containing Pacific Sardine were beyond the 5-nmi boundary of the planned nearshore transects and not used to estimate biomass (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lm)b**). Pacific Herring and Jack Mackerel were predominant between Cape Blanco and Fort Bragg, and Northern Anchovy comprised most of the purse seine catch south of Fort Bragg. Notably, no Pacific Sardine were captured in purse-seine samples between Cape Blanco and Cape Mendocino where neither _`r survey.vessel`_ nor _Shimada_ conducted trawl sampling. Overall, the `r set.summ$n[set.summ$vessel.name == "LM"]` seines captured a combined `r prettyNum(sum(seine.summ.lm$total.wt),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of CPS (`r prettyNum(seine.summ.lm$total.wt[seine.summ.lm$scientificName == "Trachurus symmetricus"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Jack Mackerel, `r prettyNum(seine.summ.lm$total.wt[seine.summ.lm$scientificName == "Sardinops sagax"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Sardine, `r prettyNum(seine.summ.lm$total.wt[seine.summ.lm$scientificName == "Clupea pallasii"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Herring, and `r prettyNum(seine.summ.lm$total.wt[seine.summ.lm$scientificName == "Engraulis mordax"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Northern Anchovy; no Pacific Mackerel were caught). 

### _Long Beach Carnage_  

Northern Anchovy and Pacific Sardine were predominant, by weight, in purse-seine samples collected by _Long Beach Carnage_ in the nearshore region (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lbc)b**). In general, Northern Anchovy were more abundant north of Pt. Conception and Pacific were more abundant to the south (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lbc)b**). Some Pacific Mackerel were collected along the mainland coast in the SCB. Few Jack Mackerel were collected in purse-seine samples collected by _Long Beach Carnage_ (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lbc)b**). Overall, dip-net samples from `r set.summ$n[set.summ$vessel.name == "LBC"]` seines totaled `r prettyNum(sum(seine.summ.lbc$total.wt),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of CPS (`r prettyNum(seine.summ.lbc$total.wt[seine.summ.lbc$scientificName == "Sardinops sagax"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Sardine, `r prettyNum(seine.summ.lbc$total.wt[seine.summ.lbc$scientificName == "Scomber japonicus"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Mackerel, `r prettyNum(seine.summ.lbc$total.wt[seine.summ.lbc$scientificName == "Engraulis mordax"],big.mark=",",digits=2)` kg of Northern Anchovy, and `r prettyNum(seine.summ.lbc$total.wt[seine.summ.lbc$scientificName == "Trachurus symmetricus"],big.mark=",",digits=2)` kg of Jack Mackerel; no Pacific Herring were caught).

It was distributed throughout the survey area south of Cape Mendocino, but was also sparsely distributed between Cape Flattery and Newport. Jack Mackerel were most abundant between Cape Mendocino and Fort Bragg and near the northern Channel Islands in the SCB (**Fig. \@ref(fig:biom-dens-jack)a**). $L_F$ ranged from `r length.summ$L.min[length.summ$scientificName == 'Trachurus symmetricus']` to `r length.summ$L.max[length.summ$scientificName == 'Trachurus symmetricus']` cm, with modes at 10 and 50 cm.

# Discussion {#discussion}  

The primary objective of the ATM surveys are to estimate the biomasses and distributions of CPS and krill within the survey area at the time of the survey. The summer 2023 survey spanned the expected distribution of the northern and southern stocks of Pacific Sardine and northern and central stocks of Northern Anchovy in U.S. waters, but also portions of the expected distribution of Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Herring. 

Despite inclement weather conditions, mechanical limitations, staffing issues, and logistical challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the loss of nearly 60% of the original 81 allocated sea days aboard _`r survey.vessel`_, the core region was surveyed by _`r survey.vessel`_ and _Shimada_ between Cape Flattery and the U.S.-Mexico border, with a slight gap in coverage between Cape Mendocino and Cape Blanco. Following the cancellation of Leg 1.1, the decision was made to forgo sampling off Vancouver Island and Baja CA to maximize the likelihood of surveying all of the transects in U.S. waters. To mitigate the loss of acoustic sampling effort north of Cape Mendocino, additional sea days were requested and granted aboard _Shimada_ to provide acoustic and net sampling north of Cape Mendocino and span the anticipated distribution of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine. The significant loss of sea days protracted the survey period and reduced the synopticity of sampling from the various sampling platforms, which deviated from the standard ATM surveys, created additional analytical challenges, and added potential uncertainty to the biomass estimates. Due to delays and lost sea days, the time between acoustic sampling from USVs and trawl sampling from _`r survey.vessel`_ and _Shimada_ was often greater than 30 d, so CPS backscatter measured from USVs was not used to estimate biomass.  

## Biomass and abundance
### Northern Anchovy {#discussion-anchovy-biomass} 
#### Northern stock {#discussion-anchovy-biomass-northern} 

The estimated biomass of the northern stock of Northern Anchovy in the survey region north of Cape Mendocino was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all$Stock == "Northern"], big.mark=",", digits = 4)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=4)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=5)` t) in summer 2023. The northern stock biomass has comprised a small fraction (`r round(min(biomass.pct.anch.n$biomass.pct),1)` to `r round(max(biomass.pct.anch.n$biomass.pct),1)`%) of the total biomass in the ATM surveys conducted in the CCE since at least 2015 [@Stierhoff2021a].  

#### Central stock {#discussion-anchovy-biomass-central}  

The estimated biomass of the central stock of Northern Anchovy in the survey region was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all$Stock == "Central"], big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Central"],big.mark=",",digits=5)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Central"],big.mark=",",digits=5)` t) and comprised `r round(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all$Stock == "Central"]/sum(be.all.summ$Biomass)*100)`% of the total CPS biomass in summer 2023. The biomass represents a ~`r (round(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Central"]/biomass.pct.anch.c$biomass[biomass.pct.anch.c$year == 2022],1)-1)*100`% increase from the `r prettyNum(biomass.pct.anch.c$biomass[biomass.pct.anch.c$year == 2022],big.mark=",",digits=5)` t estimated in summer 2022 [@Stierhoff2023b]. In 2015, the ATM survey documented a large recruitment to the central stock of Northern Anchovy, and since 2018, the central stock of Northern Anchovy has been the dominant forage fish species in the survey area (**Figs. \@ref(fig:biomass-ts-combo)a,b**).  

### Pacific Sardine {#discussion-sardine}     
#### Northern stock {#discussion-sardine-biomass-northern} 

The boundary between the northern and southern stocks of Pacific Sardine was `r names(stock.break.sar)`, based foremost on associations with potential habitat but corroborated by the geographic separation of biomass density north and south of Point Conception, and differences in demographics, growth, and lengths-at-age (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-stock-allocation))**. The estimated biomass of `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all$Stock == "Northern"], big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"], big.mark=",",digits=5)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"], big.mark=",",digits=5)` t) in the survey region was a `r round((be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Northern"]/biomass.pct.sar.n$biomass[biomass.pct.sar.n$year == 2022])-1, digits=2)*100`% increase in biomass compared to the `r prettyNum(biomass.pct.sar.n$biomass[biomass.pct.sar.n$year == 2022],big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t estimated in summer 2022 [@Stierhoff2023b]. Since 2014, the ATM biomass of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine has remained less than the 150,000 t rebuilding target adopted by the Pacific Fishery Management Council in 2020^[https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2020/08/g-1-attachment-1-pacific-sardine-rebuilding-plan-preliminary-environmental-analysis.pdf/] (**Figs. \@ref(fig:biomass-ts-combo)a,b**), continues to be mostly offshore and mixed with mackerels. The biomass estimates from 2022 and 2023 have higher CVs than prior year estimates because of modifications to survey design required by loss of sea days during each field season.  

#### Southern stock {#discussion-sardine-biomass-southern}  

The estimated biomass of the southern stock of Pacific Sardine in the survey region was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Southern"], big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Southern"], big.mark=",",digits=5)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Southern"],big.mark=",",digits=5)` t), of which `r prettyNum(be.all.ns$Biomass[be.all.ns$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all.ns$Stock == "Southern"], big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t (`r prettyNum(be.all.ns$Biomass[be.all.ns$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all.ns$Stock == "Southern"]/be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Southern"]*100, big.mark=",", digits = 1)`%) occurred in the nearshore region off southern and central CA. The biomass estimated in 2023 is the largest in the time series, which goes back to 2016. In 2023, Mexico conducted a contemporaneous survey of CPS, including nearshore, off both sides of the Baja CA peninsula [@Vallarta2024]. **Include information and comparisons from [@Vallarta2024] prior to publication.**  

The southern stock was first observed in U.S. waters by the SWFSC's ATM surveys in 2016 [`r prettyNum(biomass.pct.sar.s$biomass[biomass.pct.sar.s$year == 2016],big.mark=",", digits = 1)` t, @Stierhoff2021b]. Since then, the southern stock biomass in U.S. waters has been increasing, from `r prettyNum(biomass.pct.sar.s$biomass[biomass.pct.sar.s$year == 2018],big.mark=",", digits = 1)` t in summer 2018 [@Stierhoff2021b] to `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Southern"], big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t in summer 2023. In summer 2017, the summer survey did not extend into the SCB [@Zwolinski2019a], and no summer survey was conducted in 2020 due to COVID-19.  

### Pacific Mackerel {#discussion-mack}

In summer 2023, the estimated biomass of Pacific Mackerel in the survey region was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Scomber japonicus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Scomber japonicus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Scomber japonicus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t), which is within the range of recent estimates (`r prettyNum(min(biomass.pct.mack$biomass[biomass.pct.mack$year %in% c(2016:2022)]),big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(max(biomass.pct.mack$biomass[biomass.pct.mack$year %in% c(2016:2022)]),big.mark=",",digits=3)`) between 2016 and 2022.    

### Jack Mackerel {#discussion-jack}  

In summer 2023, the estimated biomass of Jack Mackerel in the survey region, south of Cape Flattery, was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Trachurus symmetricus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Trachurus symmetricus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Trachurus symmetricus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t), which is `r (1-round(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Trachurus symmetricus']/biomass.pct.jack$biomass[biomass.pct.jack$year == 2022],1))*100`% lower than `r prettyNum(biomass.pct.jack$biomass[biomass.pct.jack$year == 2022],big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t estimated in summer 2021 [@Stierhoff2023a].  

### Pacific Herring {#discussion-herring} 

In summer 2023, the estimated biomass of Pacific Herring in U.S. waters south of Cape Flattery, was `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Clupea pallasii'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$lower.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Clupea pallasii'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.summ$upper.ci.B[be.all.summ$Species == 'Clupea pallasii'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t), which was a `r round(((be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == 'Clupea pallasii']/biomass.pct.her$biomass[biomass.pct.her$year == 2022])-1)*100,0)`% increase from the `r prettyNum(biomass.pct.her$biomass[biomass.pct.her$year == 2022],big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t estimated in summer 2022 [@Stierhoff2023b].

## Ecosystem dynamics: Forage fish community {#discussion-ecosystem-dynamics}  

The acoustic-trawl method (ATM) has been used to monitor the biomasses and distributions of pelagic and mid-water fish stocks worldwide [e.g., @Coetzee2008; @Karp1994; @Simmonds2009]. In 2006, the SWFSC's ATM survey in the CCE focused on Pacific Sardine [@Cutter2008], but evolved to assess the five most abundant CPS [@Zwolinski2014]: Pacific Sardine, Northern Anchovy, Jack Mackerel, Pacific Mackerel, and Pacific Herring. In the CCE, ATM surveys have been used to directly assess Pacific Hake [@JTC2014; @Edwards2018]; rockfishes [@Starr1996; @Demer2012b; @Demer2012c; @Demer2012d]; Pacific Herring [@Thomas2003]; northern stock of Pacific Sardine [@Hill2017; @Kuriyama2020; @Kuriyama2022b]; northern [@Mais1974; @Mais1977] and central stocks [@Kuriyama2022a] of Northern Anchovy; and Pacific Mackerel [@Crone2015; @Crone2019]. The proportions of these stocks that are in water too shallow to be sampled by NOAA ships are estimated using samples collected from fishing vessels. Also, concurrent satellite- and ship-based measures of their biotic and abiotic habitats are used to provide an ecosystem perspective.  

Collectively, these annual or bi-annual ATM surveys provide a unique insight into the dynamics of forage fishes in the CCE, including their distributions, abundances, interactions, and environments. For example, results from 2006 through 2013 indicate that Pacific Sardine dominated the CPS assemblage, but their biomass was declining [@Demer2012a; @Zwolinski2012a] and their seasonal migration was contracting [@Zwolinski2014]. Meanwhile, harvest rates for the declining stock increased [@Demer2017], and the total forage-fish biomass decreased to less than 200,000 t in 2014 and 2015 (**Figs. \@ref(fig:biomass-ts-combo)a,b**). The U.S. fishery for Pacific Sardine was closed in 2015 [@NMFS2015], and there were reports of mass strandings, deaths, and reproductive failures in Brown Pelicans (_Pelecanus occidentalis_^[https://e360.yale.edu/features/brown_pelicans_a_test_case_for_the_endangered_species_act]), Common Murres (_Uria aalge_), Brandt’s Cormorants (_Phalacrocorax penicillatus_), and California sea lions (_Zalophus californianus_^[https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-life-distress/2013-2017-california-sea-lion-unusual-mortality-event-california]) [@McClatchie2016], all of which depend on forage species. The National Marine Fisheries Service deemed the stock 'overfished' in 2019.  

The biomass of the central stock of Northern Anchovy, which had been growing rapidly since 2015, increased by ~`r (round(be.all.summ$Biomass[be.all.summ$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be.all.summ$Stock == "Central"]/biomass.pct.anch.c$biomass[biomass.pct.anch.c$year == 2022],1)-1)*100`% from the `r prettyNum(biomass.pct.anch.c$biomass[biomass.pct.anch.c$year == 2022],big.mark=",",digits=5)` t estimated in summer 2022 [@Stierhoff2023b]. Jack Mackerel, which were found mostly north of Cape Mendocino, included an abundance of apparently age-0 fish farther south, suggesting a recruitment. The southern stock of Pacific Sardine in U.S. waters was mostly in the nearshore area. There is no indication that the biomasses of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine and the northern stock of Northern Anchovy have changed significantly since summer 2022.  

The survey-estimated CPS biomasses from summer 2008 to 2023 was dominated by northern stock Pacific Sardine until 2013, Jack Mackerel in 2014 and 2015, and then central stock of Northern Anchovy since 2015, when it was resurgent. The latter stock grew to ~2.75 million tons by 2021 [@Stierhoff2023a], and has hovered around ~2.5 million t since. Meanwhile, the biomass of Pacific Mackerel remained the lowest in the assemblage, and the biomass of Jack Mackerel trended up from 2017 through 2022. In 2023, the timing of the survey in the north area and its reduced footprint created uncertainty about the decrease observed in Jack Mackerel in 2023. The biomass of Pacific Sardine is calculated separately for the northern and southern stocks based on oceanographic habitat, spatial separation, and  demographic structure [@Zwolinski2023c]. The southern stock of Pacific Sardine has been present in U.S. waters since at least 2015, located mostly nearshore, south of Monterey Bay; the biomass of the northern stock has been fluctuating below 100,000 t off Oregon and Washington.  

<!-- **[UPDATE TO INCLUDE 2023 RESULTS?]** Since the resurgence of the central stock of Northern Anchovy, beginning in 2015, there has been consistency in the regional distributions of the three dominant species: Northern Anchovy, Jack Mackerel and Pacific Herring (**Fig. \@ref(fig:species-proportion-time-series)**). Pacific Herring are caught mostly north of central Washington. Lower biomasses of northern stock Pacific Sardine and northern stock Northern Anchovy are resident off Oregon and Northern California. Jack mackerel are caught between central Washington and Cape Mendocino, often along with fewer northern stock Pacific Sardine in recent years. Central stock Northern Anchovy are caught south of Cape Mendocino and, with the exception of summer 2021, mostly south of Bodega Bay. The smaller northern stock is resident from central Washington to northern California. The summer 2022 distribution of Northern Anchovy appears to have shifted south, better aligning with its distributions during 2015-2019. In contrast to earlier surveys in the time series, the southern stock of Pacific sardine has been persistently present during summer surveys in U.S. waters, mostly in the Southern California Bight (**Fig. \@ref(fig:species-proportion-time-series)**).   -->
