# Introduction {#introduction}

The `r survey.name.long` (`r survey.name`) was conducted by the Fisheries Resources Division (FRD) of the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) aboard NOAA ship *`r survey.vessel.long`* (hereafter *`r survey.vessel`*) (**Fig.** \@ref(fig:vessel-pic)), `r survey.start` to `r survey.end` `r survey.year`, and augmented by data collected from the fishing vessels _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_ and uncrewed surface vehicles (USVs; Saildrone, Inc.). The Acoustic-Trawl Method (ATM) is routinely used to assess coastal pelagic fish species (CPS) and krill within the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), typically between Vancouver Island, British Columbia and San Diego, CA. Starting in 2021, the survey has extended southward to include central Baja California, Mexico. Data were collected using multi-frequency echosounders, surface trawls, obliquely integrating net tows, a Continuous Underway Fish-Egg Sampler [CUFES; @Checkley1997], and conductivity-temperature-depth probes (CTDs).

The objectives for the survey were to: 1) acoustically map the distributions, measure the species compositions and size-frequency distributions, and estimate the abundances of CPS, e.g., Pacific Sardine *Sardinops sagax*, Northern Anchovy *Engraulis mordax*, Pacific Herring *Clupea pallasii*, Pacific Round Herring *Etrumeus acuminatus*, Pacific Mackerel *Scomber japonicus*, and Jack Mackerel *Trachurus symmetricus*; and krill (euphausiid spp.); 2) characterize and investigate linkages to their biotic and abiotic environments; 3) gather information regarding their life histories; and 4) use fishing vessels and USVs to sample transects and nearshore areas when and where sampling from NOAA ships was deemed inefficient, unsafe, or both (**Fig.** \@ref(fig:vessel-pic)).

The survey domain, from Cape Flattery, WA to Central Baja California, Mexico, was defined primarily by the historically observed distribution of the northern subpopulation (stock) of Pacific Sardine [@Zwolinski2011], with a southern extension permitted by available sampling effort. This area was chosen to encompass the anticipated distributions of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine and the central and northern stocks of Northern Anchovy off the west coasts of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, but it also spanned portions of the southern stock of Pacific Sardine, Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, Pacific Round Herring, and Pacific Herring.

This report provides an overview of the survey objectives and a summary of the survey equipment, sampling protocols, and data collections. This report does not include estimates of the animal distributions and biomasses, which are documented separately.

# Methods {#methods}
## Survey region and design {#methods-survey-design}

The SWFSC’s ATM surveys of CPS in the CCE began in 2006 with a focus on the northern stock of Pacific Sardine. Since then, they have expanded in scope and objectives to include the larger forage-fish assemblage and krill. This evolution, and the migratory behavior of Pacific Sardine, serve to explain the present survey region and design.  

During spring, the northern stock of Pacific Sardine typically aggregates offshore of central and southern California to spawn [@Demer2012, and reference therein]. During summer, if the stock is large enough, adults migrate north, compress along the coast, and feed in the upwelled regions (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-distribution)**). Since approximately 2012, however, the seasonal migration of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine diminished to the extent that it remains north of Cape Mendocino year-round.  

During `r tolower(survey.season)` `r survey.year`, the west coasts of the United States and Baja California were surveyed using _`r survey.vessel`_, _Lisa Marie_, _Long Beach Carnage_, and USVs. Compulsory transects were nearly perpendicular to the coast and separated by 10 nmi. The survey began off `r survey.landmark.n` and the combination of survey platforms progressed southwards toward `r survey.landmark.s`.    

The planned transects (**Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**) spanned the latitudinal extent, based on historical observations, of the anticipated distributions of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine and the central and northern stocks of Northern Anchovy. For _`r survey.vessel`_, the planned transects ranged from `r survey.landmark.n` to `r survey.landmark.s`. To increase the spatial sampling resolution from _`r survey.vessel`_, USVs were to conduct acoustic sampling interstitial to _`r survey.vessel`_ transects between Newport, OR and San Francisco, CA. To estimate CPS biomass near shore, where it is too shallow to navigate NOAA ships safely, sampling from _`r survey.vessel`_ was to be augmented with echosounder and purse-seine sampling from _Lisa Marie_ between `r survey.landmark.n` to Bodega Bay, CA; and from _Long Beach Carnage_ between Bodega Bay, CA to San Diego, CA, and around Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands (**Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**). After Leg I on _`r survey.vessel`_ was cancelled due to OMAO staffing issues, the plan was modified for _Lisa Marie_ to forego its nearshore sampling and instead survey _`r survey.vessel`_'s transects between `r survey.landmark.n` to Bodega Bay, CA using 20 nmi spacing, while the USVs would survey interstitial to _Lisa Marie_ transects starting near Grays Harbor, WA and continuing as far south as time permitted. Further due to OMAO staffing issues, Leg III on _`r survey.vessel`_ was delayed by 16 days; the plan was then modified to use the remaining four days of the leg to survey northward from San Diego, CA into the Southern California Bight using 20 nmi spacing. Leg IV on _`r survey.vessel`_ then resumed sampling southward from Monterey Bay, CA to `r survey.landmark.s`. For _`r survey.vessel`_, the offshore extent of the planned transects was adjusted during the survey according to the observed distribution of putative CPS backscatter in the echograms, CPS eggs in the CUFES samples, or CPS caught in trawls.  

(ref:sardine-distribution) Conceptual spring (shaded region) and summer (hashed region) distributions of potential habitat for the northern stock of Pacific Sardine along the west coasts of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The dashed and dotted lines represent, respectively, the approximate summer and spring positions of the 0.2 mg m^–3^ chlorophyll-a concentration isoline. This isoline appears to oscillate in synchrony with the transition zone chlorophyll front [TZCF, @Polovina2001] and the offshore limit of the northern stock Pacific Sardine potential habitat [@Zwolinski2011]. Mackerels are found within and on the edge of the same oceanographic  habitat [e.g., @Demer2012; @Zwolinski2012]. The TZCF may delineate the offshore and southern limit of both Pacific Sardine and Pacific Mackerel distributions, and juveniles may have nursery areas in the Southern California Bight, downstream of upwelling regions.

## Acoustic sampling {#methods-acoustic-sampling}
### Echosounders {#methods-echosounders}  

On _`r survey.vessel`_, multi-frequency Wideband Transceivers (18-, 38-, 70-, 120-, 200-, and 333-kHz Simrad EK80 WBTs) were configured with split-beam transducers (Simrad `r echo.models`). The transducers were mounted on the bottom of a retractable keel or "centerboard" (**Fig. \@ref(fig:cb-config)**). The keel was retracted (transducers ~`r cb.retracted`-m depth) during calibration, and extended to the intermediate position (transducers ~`r cb.intermediate`-m depth) during the survey. Exceptions were made during shallow water operations, when the keel was retracted; or during times of heavy weather, when the keel was extended (transducers ~`r cb.extended`-m depth) to provide extra stability and reduce the effect of weather-generated noise (**Appendix \@ref(appendix-cb-pos)**). Transducer position and motion were measured at 5 Hz using an inertial motion unit (POS-MV; Trimble/Applanix).  

(ref:cb-config) Transducer locations on the bottom of the centerboard aboard _`r survey.vessel`_.

```  

On _Lisa Marie_, multi-frequency Wideband Transceivers (38- and 200-kHz Simrad EK80 WBTs) were connected to the vessel's hull-mounted split-beam transducers (Simrad ES38-7 and ES200-7C).

On _Long Beach Carnage_, the SWFSC's multi-frequency General Purpose Transceivers (38-, 70-, 120-, and 200-kHz Simrad EK60 GPTs) were configured with the SWFSC's split-beam transducers (Simrad ES38-12, ES70-7C, ES120-7C and ES200-7C) mounted in a multi-frequency transducer array (MTA4) on the bottom of a pole (**Fig. \@ref(fig:cb-config-lbc)**).  

On the two USVs (SD-1076 and SD-1077), miniature Wideband Transceivers (Simrad WBT Mini) were configured with gimbaled, keel-mounted, dual-frequency transducers (Simrad ES38-18|200-18C) containing a split-beam 38-kHz transducer and single-beam 200-kHz transducer with nominally 18$^\circ$ beamwidths.

### Calibrations {#methods-echosounder-calibration}  

The echosounder systems on each vessel were calibrated using the standard sphere technique [@Foote1987;@Demer2015]. On _`r survey.vessel`_, each WBT was calibrated in both CW (continuous wave or narrowband mode) and FM modes (frequency modulation or broadband mode). For both modes, the reference target was a `r cal.sphere`; For FM mode, additional calibrations were conducted for the 120, 200, and 333-kHz echosounders using a smaller 25-mm WC sphere. Calibrations for _Lisa Marie_, _Long Beach Carnage_, and the USVs were all conducted using a WC38.1. For each vessel, the calibration parameters were derived in Echoview and subsequently applied in the data processing (see **Section \@ref(results-echosounder-calibration)**).  

### Data collection {#methods-acoustic-data-collection}  

On _`r survey.vessel`_, the computer clocks were synchronized with the GPS clock (UTC) using synchronization software (NetTime^[http://timesynctool.com]). The 18-kHz WBT, operated by a separate PC from the other echosounders, was programmed to track the seabed and output the detected depth to the ship’s Scientific Computing System (SCS). The 38-, 70-, 120-, 200-, and 333-kHz echosounders were controlled by the EK80 Adaptive Logger [EAL^[https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/science-data/ek80-adaptive-logger/], @Renfree2016]. The EAL optimizes the pulse interval based on the seabed depth, while avoiding aliased seabed echoes, and was programmed such that once an hour the echosounders would record three pings in passive mode, for obtaining estimates of the background noise level. Acoustic sampling for CPS-density estimation along the pre-determined transects was limited to daylight hours (approximately between sunrise and sunset).

Measurements of volume backscattering strength ($S_v$; dB re 1 m^2^ m^-3^) and target strength ($TS$; dB re 1 m^2^), indexed by time and geographic positions provided by GPS receivers, were logged to 60 m beyond the detected seabed range or to a maximum range of 500, 500, 500, 300, and 150 m for 38, 70, 120, 200, and 333 kHz, respectively, and stored in Simrad .raw format with a `r raw.size`-GB maximum file size. During daytime and nighttime, the echosounders were set to operate in CW and FM modes, respectively. For each acoustic instrument, the prefix for each file name is a concatenation of the survey name (e.g.,  `r survey.name`), the operational mode (CW or FM), and the logging commencement date and time from the EK80 software. For example, a file generated by the Simrad EK80 software (`r ek80.version`) for a WBT operated in CW mode is named `2207RL_CW-D20220826-T155651.raw`.   

To minimize acoustic interference, transmit pulses from the EK80s, acoustic Doppler current profiler and echosounder (Simrad EC150-3C), multibeam echosounder (Simrad ME70), imaging sonar (Simrad MS70), scanning sonar (Simrad SX90), and a separate acoustic Doppler current profiler (Teledyne RD Instruments OS75 ADCP) were triggered using a synchronization system (Simrad K-Sync). The K-Sync trigger rate, and thus the echosounder ping interval, was modulated by the EAL using the 18-kHz seabed depth provided by _`r survey.vessel`_'s Scientific Computing System (SCS). During daytime, the EC150-3C, ME70, SX90, and ADCP were operated continuously, while the MS70 was only operated at times when CPS were present. At nighttime, only the EK80, EC150-3C, and ADCP were operated. All other instruments that can produce sound within the EK80's CW bandwidths were secured during daytime-survey operations. Exceptions were made during stations (e.g., plankton sampling and fish trawling) or in shallow water when the vessel's command occasionally operated the bridge's 50- and 200-kHz echosounders (Furuno), the Doppler velocity log (Model SRD-500A, Sperry Marine), or both.

On _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_, the EAL was used to control the EK80 software to modulate the echosounder recording ranges and ping intervals to avoid aliased seabed echoes. When the EAL was not utilized, the EK80 software recorded to 1000 m and used the maximum ping rate. Transmit pulses from the EK60s and fishing sonars were not synchronized. Therefore, the latter was secured during daytime acoustic transects.

On the USVs, the echosounders were programmed to transmit CW pulses to a range dependent on the transect depth. For deeper seabed depths, the ping interval was 2 s and the 38 and 200-kHz echosounders recorded to 1000 and 400 m, respectively. For shallower depths, the ping interval was 1 s and both echosounders recorded to 250 m. Once an hour, the echosounders would operate in passive mode and record three pings to obtain estimates of the background noise level.

### Data processing {#methods-acoustic-data-processing}  

Echoes from schooling CPS and plankton (**Figs. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)a, d**) were identified using a semi-automated data processing algorithm implemented using Echoview software (`r ev.version`; Echoview Software Pty Ltd). The filters and thresholds were based on a subsample of echoes from randomly selected CPS schools. The aim of the filter criteria is to retain at least 95% of the noise-free backscatter from CPS while rejecting at least 95% of the non-CPS backscatter (**Fig. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)**). Data from _`r survey.vessel`_ and _Long Beach Carnage_ were processed using the following steps:  

1. Match geometry of all $S_v$ variables to the 38-kHz $S_v$;
2. Remove passive-mode pings;
3. Estimate and subtract background noise using the background noise removal function [@DeRobertis2007] in Echoview (**Figs. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)b, e**);
4. Average the noise-free $S_v$ echograms using non-overlapping 11-sample by 3-ping bins;
5. Expand the averaged, noise-reduced _S~v~_ echograms with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation;
6. For each pixel, compute: $S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$, $S_{v,\mathrm{120kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$, and $S_{v,\mathrm{70kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$;
7. Create a Boolean echogram for $S_v$ differences in the CPS range: $-13.85 < S_{v,\mathrm{70kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 9.89 \text{ and} -13.5 < S_{v,\mathrm{120kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 9.37 \text{ and} -13.51 < S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 12.53$;
8. Compute the 120- and 200-kHz Variance-to-Mean Ratios [$VMR_{\mathrm{120kHz}}$ and $VMR_{\mathrm{200kHz}}$, respectively, @Demer2009a] using the difference between noise-filtered $S_v$ (Step 3) and averaged $S_v$ (Step 4);
9. Expand the $VMR_{\mathrm{120kHz}}$ and $VMR_{\mathrm{200kHz}}$ echograms with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation;
10. Create a Boolean echogram based on the $VMR$s in the CPS range: $VMR_{\mathrm{120kHz}}$ > -65 dB and $VMR_{\mathrm{200kHz}}$ > -65 dB. Diffuse backscattering layers have low $VMR$ [@Zwolinski2010] whereas fish schools have high $VMR$ [@Demer2009a];
11. Intersect the two Boolean echograms to create an echogram with "TRUE" samples for candidate CPS schools and "FALSE" elsewhere;
12. Mask the noise-reduced echograms using the CPS Boolean echogram (**Figs. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)c, f**);
13. Create an integration-start line `r int.start` m below the transducer (~10 m depth);
14. Create an integration-stop line `r adz.range` m above the estimated seabed [@Demer2009a], or to the maximum logging range (e.g., `r int.stop` m), whichever is shallowest;
15. Set the minimum $S_v$ threshold to -60 dB (corresponding to a density of approximately three 20-cm-long Pacific Sardine per 100 m^3^);
16. Integrate the volume backscattering coefficients ($s_V$, m^2^ m^-3^) attributed to CPS over 5-m depths and averaged over 100-m distances;
17. Output the resulting nautical area scattering coefficients ($s_A$; m^2^ nmi^-2^) and associated information from each transect and frequency to comma-delimited text (.csv) files.  

Data from _Lisa Marie_ and the USVs were processed using the following steps:

1. Match geometry of the $S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}$ to the $S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$;
2. Remove passive-mode pings;
3. Perform Steps 3-5 from _`r survey.vessel`_ processing;
4. For each pixel, compute: $S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$;
5. Create a Boolean echogram for $S_v$ differences in the CPS range: $-13.5 < S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 9.37$
6. Perform Steps 8-9 from _`r survey.vessel`_ processing;
7. Create a Boolean echogram mask using $VMR$ > -57 dB;
8. Performs Steps 11-17 from _`r survey.vessel`_ processing.  

When necessary, the start and stop integration lines were manually edited to exclude reverberation due to bubbles, to include the entirety of shallow CPS aggregations, or to exclude seabed echoes.  Echoes suspected to be from rockfish schools were further excluded.

## Trawl sampling {#methods-trawl-sampling}  

During the day, CPS form schools, typically in the upper mixed layer [e.g., from the surface to 70-m depth in the spring, @Kim2005], and generally shallower in summer. After sunset, CPS schools tend to ascend and disperse; at that time, with reduced visibility and no schooling behavior, they are less able to avoid a net [@Mais1974]. Therefore, trawl sampling for identifying the species composition and length distributions of acoustic targets was performed at night.  

On _`r survey.vessel`_, the net, a Nordic 264 rope trawl (NET Systems; Bainbridge Island, WA; **Figs. \@ref(fig:trawl-diagrams)a, b**), has a rectangular opening in the fishing portion of the net with an area of approximately 300 m^2^ (~15-m tall x 20-m wide), variable-sized mesh in the throat, an 8-mm square-mesh cod-end liner (to retain a large range of animal sizes), and a "marine mammal excluder device" to prevent the capture of larger animals, such as dolphins, turtles, or sharks [@Dotson2010]. The trawl doors are foam-filled and the trawl headrope is lined with floats so the trawl opening spans from the surface to about 15-m depth.

Up to three nighttime (i.e., 60 min after sunset to 30 min before sunrise) surface trawls, typically spaced 5-10 nmi-apart, were conducted in areas where echoes from putative CPS schools were observed in echograms or eggs were observed in the CUFES earlier that day. Each evening, trawl locations were selected based on the acoustic and CUFES data using the following criteria, in descending priority: CPS schools in echograms that day, CPS eggs in CUFES samples that day, and the trawl locations and catches during the previous night. If no CPS echoes or CPS eggs were observed along the transect(s) that day, trawls were alternatively placed nearshore one night and offshore the next night, with consideration given to the seabed depth and the modeled distribution of Pacific Sardine habitat.  

Trawls were towed at ~4 kn for 45 min. The total catch from each trawl was weighed and sorted by species or groups. From the catches with CPS, specimens were selected randomly for each of the target species (up to 75 for Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy and up to 50 for Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Herring). Those were weighed and measured to either their standard length ($L_S$; mm) for Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy, or fork length ($L_F$; mm) for Jack Mackerel, Pacific Mackerel, Pacific Round Herring, and Pacific Herring. In addition, sex and maturity were visually determined and recorded for up to 75 specimens from Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy and up to 25 for Pacific and Jack Mackerels. Ovaries were preserved of each CPS, except Pacific Herring, for subsequent histological processing to validate maturity. For each CPS, ovaries (either whole or partial) were preserved for up to 10 specimens from each maturity code (immature specimens: maturity code 1; mature specimens: maturity codes 2-4), enabling an evaluation of accuracy for personnel who assessed maturity. Fin clips were removed from 50 Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy specimens each from seven different geographic zones (designated by J. Hyde and M. Craig, SWFSC) and preserved in ethanol for genetic analysis. Otoliths were removed from up to 50 Pacific Sardine in the subsample; for other CPS species (except Pacific Herring), 25 otoliths were removed from fish representing the range of lengths present, for age determination as described in @Schwartzkopf2022 and @Dorval2022. The combined catches of CPS in up to three trawls per night (i.e., trawl cluster) were used to estimate the proportions of species contributing to the nearest samples of acoustic backscatter.

## Purse seine sampling {#methods-seine-sampling}  

Purse seine nets were set to provide information about size, age, and species composition of fishes observed in the echosounders mounted on the fishing vessels. _Lisa Marie_ used an approximately 440-m-long and 40-m-deep net with 17-mm-wide mesh (A. Blair, pers. comm.). _Long Beach Carnage_ used an approximately 200-m-long and 27-m-deep net with 17-mm-wide mesh; a small section on the back end of the net had 25-mm-wide mesh (R. Ashley, pers. comm.). Specimens collected by _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_ were processed by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) and California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), respectively.

On _Lisa Marie_, as many as five purse seine sets were planned each day. Originally the vessel was assigned to sample nearshore transects, for which there would be one set per transect. However, after Leg I on _`r survey.vessel`_ was cancelled and _Lisa Marie_ was redirected to survey _`r survey.vessel`_'s transects, the plan was modified to allow _Lisa Marie_ to randomly set on observed schools during a transect, for up to five sets per transect. For each set, three dip net samples, spatially separated as much as possible, were collected. For each dip net sample, all specimens were sorted, weighed, and counted to provide a combined weight and count for each. Next, all three dip net samples were combined and up to 50 specimens of each CPS species were randomly sampled to provide a combined weight for each set. The length (mm; $L_S$ for Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy and $L_F$ for all others) and weight was measured for up to 50 randomly selected specimens of each species. Otoliths were extracted, macroscopic maturity stage was determined visually, and gonads were collected and preserved from female specimens.

On _Long Beach Carnage_, as many as five purse seine sets were planned each day, including evenings, for an average of one set per transect. The vessel was to run each transect in its entirety, then randomly set on an observed school. The total weight (tons) of the school was estimated by the captain. For each set, three dip net samples, spatially separated as much as possible, were collected. For each dip net sample, all specimens were sorted, weighed, and counted to provide a combined weight and count for each. From each dip net sample, as many as 20 fish of each CPS species were chosen randomly throughout the sample, and combined for a random sample of 50 fish collected throughout the catch. The fish were then frozen for later analysis by CDFW biologists, yielding measures of total sample weight and individual fish weight, length (mm; $L_S$ for Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy and $L_F$ for all others), maturity, and otolith-derived ages. Because samples were frozen, no gonad samples from female specimens were analyzed.

## Ichthyoplankton and oceanographic sampling {#methods-other-sampling}
### Egg and larva sampling {#methods-egg-sampling}  

On _`r survey.vessel`_, fish eggs were collected during the day using a CUFES, which collects water and plankton at a rate of ~640 l min^-1^ from an intake on the hull of the ship at ~3-m depth. For each vessel, the particles in the sampled water were sieved by a 505- and 500-$\mu$m mesh, respectively. Pacific Sardine, Northern Anchovy, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Hake (_Merluccius productus_) eggs were identified to species, counted, and logged. Eggs from other species (e.g., Pacific Mackerel and flatfishes) were also counted and logged as "other fish eggs". Typically, the duration of each CUFES sample was 30 min, corresponding to a distance of 5 nmi at a speed of 10 kn. Because the durations of the initial egg stages is short for most CPS, the egg distributions inferred from CUFES samples indicate the nearby presence of actively spawning fish.

On _`r survey.vessel`_, a CalCOFI bongo oblique net [a bridleless pair of 71-cm diameter nets with 505-$\mu$m mesh, @Smith1977] was used opportunistically to sample ichthyoplankton and krill after sunset, to contribute to the CalCOFI ichthyoplankton time series. Where there was adequate depth, 300 m of wire was deployed at a rate of 50 m min^-1^ and then retrieved at 20 m min^-1^, at a nominal wire angle of 45$^\circ$. Bongo samples were stored in 5% buffered formalin.  

### Conductivity and temperature versus depth (CTD) sampling {#methods-ctd-sampling}  

On _`r survey.vessel`_, conductivity and temperature were measured versus depth to `r ctd.cast.depth` and 500 m, respectively, using calibrated sensors on a probe cast from the vessel while on station (CTD), or a probe cast from the vessel while underway (UnderwayCTD, or UCTD; Teledyne Oceanscience). These data indicate the depth of the surface mixed layer, above which most epipelagic CPS reside during the day, which is later used to determine the integration-stop depth during acoustic data processing. These data were also used to estimate the time-averaged sound speed [@Demer2004c], for estimating ranges to the sound scatterers, and frequency-specific sound absorption coefficients, for compensating signal attenuation of the sound pulse between the transducer and scatterers [@Simmonds2005].

Due to the cancellation of Leg I, _`r survey.vessel`_ did not survey north of Cape Mendocino, CA. Therefore, oceanographic data was obtained from CTD casts during the Northwest Fisheries Science Center's (NWFSC) 2022 Integrated Ecosystem and Pacific Hake Acoustic-Trawl Survey aboard NOAA ship _Shimada_, which spanned a region from Cape Flattery, WA to Coos Bay, OR. The nearest CTD data from either _`r survey.vessel`_ or _Shimada_ was then used for processing acoustic data collected from _Lisa Marie_ or the USVs.

# Results {#results}
## Echosounder calibrations {#results-echosounder-calibration}  

For _`r survey.vessel`_, the EK80s were calibrated on `r cal.datetime` while the vessel was alongside the pier near `r cal.loc` (`r cal.lat.dd` $^\circ$N, `r cal.lon.dd` $^\circ$W). Measurements of sea-surface temperature ($t_w$ = `r cal.temp` $^\circ$C) and salinity ($s_w$ = `r cal.sal` psu) were measured to a depth of 10 m using a handheld probe (Pro2030, YSI) and input to the WBT-control software (EK80 `r ek80.version`, Simrad), which derived estimates of sound speed ($c_w$ = `r cal.c` m s^-1^) and absorption coefficients. The centerboard was placed in the Retracted position, which resulted in the seabed being approximately `r cal.min.z` to `r cal.max.z` m beneath the transducers, depending on the tide. The calibration spheres were positioned in the far-field of each transducer, at 3.5- to 7-m range. WBT information, settings, and calibration results are presented in **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results)**. Measurements of beam-compensated sphere target strength relative to the theoretical target strength ($TS_{rel}$, dB re 1 m^2^) are presented in **Fig. \@ref(fig:tsc-plot)**. Measurements of gains, beamwidths, and offset angles from WBTs operated in FM mode are presented in **Fig. \@ref(fig:cal-plot-fm)**.

The core survey region spanned an area from approximately `r survey.landmark.n` to `r survey.landmark.s` (**Fig. \@ref(fig:transects-and-habitat)**), predominantly including the potential habitat for the northern stock of Pacific Sardine at the time of the survey^[https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/sardine_habitat_modis.html]. Due to the cancellation of Leg I on _`r survey.vessel`_, _Lisa Marie_ surveyed the northern region from Cape Flattery, WA to Bodega Bay, CA, while _`r survey.vessel`_ surveyed from Cape Mendocino, CA to `r survey.landmark.s`. The two USVs surveyed interstitial to the _Lisa Marie_ and _`r survey.vessel`_ transects from Grays Harbor, WA to Cape Mendocino, CA. In total, _`r survey.vessel`_, _Lisa Marie_, and the two USVs sampled `r n_distinct(nasc.summ$transect.name)` east-west transects totaling `r prettyNum(sum(nasc.summ$distance), digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` nmi, and conducted `r nrow(filter(haul.pie, vessel.name == "RL"))` Nordic trawls and `r nrow(filter(haul.pie, vessel.name == "LM"))` purse seine sets.

```  

The nearshore region was surveyed by _Long Beach Carnage_ and spanned an area from approximately Bodega Bay, CA to San Diego, CA, including around Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands, completing `r nrow(nasc.summ.lbc.ns)` east-west transects totaling `r sprintf("%.0f",sum(nasc.summ.lbc.ns$distance))` nmi and `r nrow(lbc.sets)` purse seine sets (**Figs. \@ref(fig:transects-and-habitat) and \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lbc)**).

**Leg I**  

Leg I on _`r survey.vessel`_ was canceled due to OMAO staffing issues. _Lisa Marie_ was therefore directed to sample the Leg I _`r survey.vessel`_ transects in lieu of its nearshore transects. _Lisa Marie_ sampled core-region compulsory Transects 178 to 143 between Cape Flattery, WA to Port Orford, OR, from 6 to 20 July. Two USVs (SD-1076 and SD-1077) sampled Transects 170 to 160, between Copalis Beach, WA to Tillamook Bay, OR, from 9 to 22 July.

**Leg II**  

On 21 July, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from the 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego, CA at ~1745 (all times GMT). Prior to the transit north, a calibration for the Simrad EC150-3C ADCP and echosounder was attempted northwest of the sea buoy outside San Diego Bay (32.6598 N,  117.3833 W), but had to be abandoned due to GPS data-format incompatibilities. Due to departure delays, sampling North of Cape Mendocino was abandoned. Throughout the transit, sampling was conducted during the day with CUFES, EK80s, ME70, MS70 and SX90 while personnel continued to troubleshoot GPS issues and test equipment. On 25 July, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the waypoint offshore of Cape Mendocino, CA at ~1930 and conducted one blind tow before initiating acoustic sampling on transect 129 at sunrise. Encountering CPS echoes on the first transect, adaptive sampling was initiated. On 26 July, Simrad representative David Barbee resolved the issues with GPS and attitude data inputs to the EK80s. ADCP calibrations were successfully completed on 27 July, taking advantage of good weather conditions, close proximity to the intended trawl locations, and the last couple hours of daylight. On 29 July, _`r survey.vessel`_ ceased adaptive transect sampling after completing transect 119. Small boat operations were conducted near Point Arena on 30 July at ~0230 to embark acoustician Scott Mau, a _`r survey.vessel`_’s Junior Officer, and a trawl team member. On 4 August, _`r survey.vessel`_ completed transect 103 off Monterey, CA, ceased acoustic sampling, and transited to Point Conception, CA for lander recovery. The lander was recovered on 5 August at ~1400 before _`r survey.vessel`_ continued south to San Diego. On 6 August, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego, CA at ~1400 to complete Leg II.

_Lisa Marie_ sampled core-region Transects 141 to 114, between Cape Sebastian, OR to Bodega Bay, CA, from 21 July to 1 August. On 2 August, on its transit north, _Lisa Marie_ resampled Transect 133, which had previously been sampled during Leg II but did not record EK80 data. On 3 August, _Lisa Marie_ returned to Wesport, WA to conclude its portion of the 2022 Summer CCE survey.

The two USVs (SD-1076 and SD-1077) sampled core-region Transects 158 to 146, between Neskowin, OR to Bandon, OR, from 23 July to 13 August.

_Long Beach Carnage_ sampled nearshore Transects 227 to 186, between Bodega Bay, CA to Morro Bay, CA, from 30 July to 5 August. 

**Leg III** 

On 26 August, after a 16-day delay due to OMAO staffing issues, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from the 10th Avenue Marine Terminal Pier in San Diego, CA at ~1400. Due to the limited survey time available on Leg III, the survey plan was adjusted northward from San Diego, CA, and acoustic sampling resumed along transect 72 at ~1930 on 26 August.  A total of five transects were completed in the Southern California Bight.  On 29 August, acoustic sampling ceased after the completion of transect 78 off of Long Beach, CA. On 30 August, after completing a compass calibration outside of the San Diego sea buoy, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego, CA at ~1900 to complete Leg III.

The two USVs (SD-1076 and SD-1077) sampled core-region Transects 144 to 122, between Cape Blanco, OR to Beaver Point, CA, from 9  to 31 August.

[**UPDATE AFTER CSV FILES ARE READY**]
_Long Beach Carnage_ sampled nearshore Transects 185 to XXX, between Point Buchon, CA to the USA/Mexico border, and the Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands, from 20 August to XX.  

**Leg IV** 

At ~1615 on 9 September, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego, CA. At ~1430 on 12 September, _`r survey.vessel`_ resumed acoustic sampling along transect 103 off Monterey, CA. At ~0330 on 16 September, an acoustic lander was deployed at 34.438635 N,  120.54667 W. At 0330 on 17 September, scientists Dayv Lowry and Daniel Hernandez Cruz were embarked via small craft in Santa Barbara Harbor, CA. At 0330 on 24 September, scientist Brittany Schwarzkopf disembarked and _`r survey.vessel`_'s XO embarked via small craft in Mission Bay, CA. At 0200 on 29 September, acoustic sampling ceased at sunset along transect 54 off Punta Baja, Baja California. At 0700 on 30 September, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego, CA to conclude the 2022 Summer CCE survey.

### Ichthyoplankton and oceanographic sampling {#results-other-sampling}  

A total of 8 CTD casts and `r nrow(uctd.sta)` UCTD casts were conducted from _`r survey.vessel`_ (**Fig. \@ref(fig:station-sampling)** and **Appendix \@ref(appendix-ctd-sampling)**), and `r prettyNum(nrow(cufes.all), digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` CUFES samples were collected underway.  A total of `r nrow(ctd.sh)` CTD casts were obtained from the NWFSC's 2022 Integrated Ecosystem and Pacific Hake Acoustic-Trawl Survey aboard _Shimada_, which were utilized for processing the _Lisa Marie_ and USV transects off of Oregon and Washington.

## Distribution of CPS {#results-cps-distribution}
### Core region  

[**UPDATE**]
Acoustic backscatter ascribed to CPS (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)a**), sampled by _`r survey.vessel`_, _Lisa Marie_, and the USVs, was observed throughout the survey area, but was most prevalent: nearshore between Cape Flattery, WA to Newport, OR, Cape Blanco, OR to Cape Mendocino, CA, and in Baja California; offshore in the Southern California Bight; and dispersed both nearshore and offshore off the coast of California between Cape Mendocino and Point Conception. 

Pacific Sardine eggs were abundant in CUFES samples offshore of the Columbia River; offshore between Newport and Cape Blanco, OR; between Tijuana and El Rosario, MX; and off Maria, MX (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)b**). Northern Anchovy eggs were most abundant in the Southern California Bight and off San Antonio, MX; and to a lesser extent off of Newport, OR, between Fort Bragg and Bodega Bay, CA, and outside Monterey Bay, CA. Jack Mackerel eggs were observed offshore between Westport, WA and the mouth of the Columbia River; between Newport, OR and Cape Mendocino, CA; and between San Francisco and Monterey Bay, CA. Jack Mackerel eggs were coincident with Pacific Sardine eggs north of Cape Mendocino, CA.  

Pacific Sardine were caught in trawls predominantly: between Newport and Cape Blanco, OR; in the Southern California Bight; and between Punta Colonet and Punta Abreojos, MX (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**). Northern Anchovy were collected throughout the entire survey area south of Oregon. Jack Mackerel were most abundant throughout the survey area between Westport, WA and Cape Mendocino, CA; and in the Southern Califonia Bight down to Punta Abreojos, MX. Pacific Mackerel were caught predominantly between Rosario and Punta Abreojos, MX. Pacific Herring were most abundant off the mouth of the Columbia River and near the border of Oregon and California. Round Herring were only observed north of Punta Eugenia and near Punta Abreojos, MX. The combined catches of the `r nrow(trawl.summ)` trawls included `r prettyNum(haul.CPS.kg, digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` kg of CPS (`r prettyNum(haul.Sardine.kg, digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` kg Pacific Sardine, `r prettyNum(haul.Anchovy.kg, digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` kg Northern Anchovy, `r prettyNum(haul.JackMack.kg, digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` kg Jack Mackerel, `r prettyNum(haul.PacMack.kg, digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` kg Pacific Mackerel, `r prettyNum(haul.PacHerring.kg, digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` kg Pacific Herring, and `r prettyNum(haul.RndHerring.kg, digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` kg Round Herring; **Appendix \@ref(appendix-trawl-sampling)**).

# Discussion {#discussion}  

The principal objectives of the `r survey.das`-day Summer 2021 CCE Survey were to survey the northern stock of Pacific Sardine and the northern and central stocks of Northern Anchovy. Then, as possible, to survey the stocks of Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, Pacific Herring, Pacific Round Herring, and the southern stock of Pacific Sardine. For the first time, the domain of the CCE survey extended coverage into Mexico. The combined sampling from _`r survey.vessel`_, _Lisa Marie_, _Long Beach Carnage_, and Saildrones spanned the offshore and nearshore areas from Cape Flattery, WA to Punta Abreojos, MX. The forage fish assemblage was dominated by Jack Mackerel between Westport, WA and Cape Mendocino, CA; Northern Anchovy between Cape Mendocino and El Rosario, MX; and Pacific Sardine between Punta Eugenia, MX and Punta Abreojos, MX. Sardine were virtually absent from catches between Cape Blanco, OR and Monterey Bay, CA, a distance of over 700 km.
