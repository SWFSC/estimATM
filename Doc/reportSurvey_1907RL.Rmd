# Introduction {#introduction}
The `r survey.name.long` (`r survey.name`) was conducted by the Fisheries Resources Division (FRD) of the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) aboard NOAA Ship _`r survey.vessel.long`_ (hereafter, _`r survey.vessel`_), fishing vessels _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_, and three unmanned
sailboats (**Fig. \@ref(fig:vessel-pic)**), `r survey.start` to `r survey.end` `r survey.year`. The Acoustic-Trawl Method (ATM) was used to assess coastal pelagic fish species (CPS) and krill within the CCE. Data were collected using multi-frequency echosounders, surface trawls, obliquely integrating net tows, a continuous underway fish-egg sampler (CUFES), and conductivity-temperature-depth probes (CTDs).  

The objectives for the survey were to: 1) acoustically map the distributions and estimate the abundances of CPS, i.e., Pacific Sardine _Sardinops sagax_, Northern Anchovy _Engraulis mordax_, Pacific Herring _Clupea pallasii_, Pacific Mackerel _Scomber japonicus_, and Jack Mackerel _Trachurus symmetricus_; and krill (euphausiid spp.); 2) characterize and investigate linkages to their biotic and abiotic environments; 3) gather information regarding their life histories; and 4) use fishing vessels and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to sample in offshore and nearshore areas when and where sampling from NOAA ships is inefficient, unsafe, or both (**Fig. \@ref(fig:vessel-pic)**).  

The survey domain was defined by the modeled distribution of potential habitat for the northern subpopulation (stock) of Pacific Sardine [@Zwolinski2011], and information recently gathered from other research projects [e.g., California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) samples] or fishing industry reports (e.g., catch and bycatch data). This area encompassed the anticipated distributions of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine and the central and northern stocks of Northern Anchovy off the west coasts of the U.S. and Canada from approximately `r survey.landmark.s`, to `r survey.landmark.n`, but also spanned portions of the southern stock of Pacific Sardine, and stocks of Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Herring.  

This report provides an overview of the survey objectives and a summary of the survey equipment, acoustic-system calibration, sampling and analysis methods, and preliminary results. This report does not include estimates of the animal distributions and biomasses, which are documented separately. Advantages and disadvantages of sampling from NOAA ships, fishing vessels, and USVs are discussed.

# Methods {#methods}
## Survey region and design {#methods-survey-design}

The SWFSC’s ATM surveys of CPS in the CCE began in 2006 with a focus on the northern stock of Pacific Sardine. Since then, they have expanded in scope and objectives to include the larger forage-fish assemblage and krill. This evolution, and the migratory behavior of Pacific Sardine, serve to explain the present survey region and design.  

During spring, the northern stock of Pacific Sardine typically aggregates offshore of central and southern California to spawn [@Demer2012, and reference therein]. During summer, if the stock is large enough, adults will migrate north, compress along the coast, and feed in the upwelled regions (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-distribution)**).  

During `r tolower(survey.season)` `r survey.year`, the west coasts of the United States and Vancouver Island, Canada, were surveyed using _`r survey.vessel`_, _Lisa Marie_, _Long Beach Carnage_, and three USVs. Compulsory transects were nearly perpendicular to the coast with separations of 10 to 20 nmi. The survey began off `r survey.landmark.n`, and progressed southwards toward `r survey.landmark.s`. Irrespective of the size of the stock and the extent of its migration, the northern stock of Pacific Sardine tends to reside within its potential habitat [@Zwolinski2011].  

The planned transects (**Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**) spanned the latitudinal extent of the potential habitat of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine^[http://swfscdata.nmfs.noaa.gov/AST/sardineHabitat/habitat.asp] at the time of the survey (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-habitat)**). Transect positions, lengths, and spaces were adjusted during the survey according to the observed distribution of putative CPS backscatter in the echosounders, CPS eggs in CUFES samples, or CPS caught in trawls. To estimate CPS biomass in offshore waters not routinely sampled during CCE surveys, sampling was also conducted by _`r survey.vessel`_ and two USVs (SD-1045 and SD-1046) along ~100 nmi-long extensions of compulsory transects spaced ~40 nmi-apart between approximately Florence, OR and San Diego. To estimate CPS biomass near shore, where it is too shallow to navigate NOAA ships safely, sampling from _`r survey.vessel`_ was augmented with echosounder and purse-seine sampling from two fishing vessels, and echosounder sampling from a third USV. The coasts of WA and OR were surveyed by F/V _Lisa Marie_; the coasts of WA, OR, and CA (north of Pt. Conception) were surveyed by a USV; and the coasts of the Southern CA Bight (SCB), and Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands were surveyed by F/V _Long Beach Carnage_.  

(ref:sardine-distribution) Conceptual spring (shaded region) and summer (hashed region) distributions of potential habitat for the northern stock of Pacific Sardine along the west coasts of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The dashed and dotted lines represent, respectively, the approximate summer and spring positions of the 0.2 mg m^–3^ chlorophyll-a concentration isoline. This isoline appears to oscillate in synchrony with the transition zone chlorophyll front [TZCF, @Polovina2001] and the offshore limit of the northern stock Pacific Sardine potential habitat [@Zwolinski2011]. Mackerels are found within and on the edge of the same oceanographic  habitat [e.g., @Demer2012; @Zwolinski2012]. The TZCF may delineate the offshore and southern limit of both Pacific Sardine and Pacific Mackerel distributions, and juveniles may have nursery areas in the Southern California Bight (SCB), downstream of upwelling regions.

## Acoustic sampling {#methods-acoustic-sampling}
### Echosounders {#methods-echosounders}  

On _`r survey.vessel`_, multi-frequency EK60 General Purpose Transceivers (18- and 38-kHz GPTs; Simrad) and EK80 Wideband Transceivers (70-, 120-, 200-, and 333-kHz WBTs; Simrad) were configured with split-beam transducers (`r echo.models`, respectively; Simrad). The transducers were mounted on the bottom of a retractable keel or "centerboard" (**Fig. \@ref(fig:cb-config)**). The keel was retracted (transducers ~`r cb.retracted`-m depth) during calibration, and extended to the intermediate position (transducers ~`r cb.intermediate`-m depth) during the survey. Exceptions were made during shallow water operations, when the keel was retracted; or during times of heavy weather, when the keel was extended (transducers ~`r cb.extended`-m depth) to provide extra stability and reduce the effect of weather-generated noise (**Appendix \@ref(appendix-cb-pos)**). Transducer position and motion were measured at 5 Hz using an inertial motion unit (POS-MV, Trimble/Applanix).  

(ref:cb-config) Transducer locations on the bottom of the centerboard aboard _`r survey.vessel`_.

  include_graphics(here("Images/img_centerboard_config_RL.png"))
} else {
  include_graphics(here("Images/img_centerboard_config_SH.png"))
}
```  

On the three USVs (SD-1045, SD-1046, and SD-1047), a miniature Wide Band Transceiver (WBT Mini, Simrad) was configured with a gimbaled, keel-mounted, dual-frequency transducer (ES38-18|200-18C, Simrad), containing a split-beam 38 kHz and single-beam 200 kHz with nominally 18$^\circ$ beamwidths. On _Lisa Marie_, the SWFSC’s echosounder (Simrad EK60 GPT) was connected to the vessel's hull-mounted 38-kHz split-beam transducer (Simrad ES38-B). On _Long Beach Carnage_, the SWFSC's multi-frequency echosounders (38-, 70-, 120-, and 200-kHz EK60 GPTs; Simrad) were configured with the SWFSC's multi-frequency transducer array (MTA4) with split-beam transducers (ES38-12, ES70-7C, ES120-7C and ES200-7C; Simrad) mounted on the bottom of a pole.  

### Calibrations {#methods-echosounder-calibration}  
On _`r survey.vessel`_, the transducer integrities were first verified through transducer-impedance measurements in water and air using an LCR meter (Agilent E4980A) and custom software (MATLAB; MathWorks, Inc.). The impedance magnitude ($|Z|$, $\Omega$), phase ($\theta$, $^\circ$), conductance ($G$, $S$), susceptance ($B$, $S$), resistance ($R$, $\Omega$), and reactance ($X$, $\Omega$) were measured over broadband frequency ranges for each transducer quadrant (**Appendix \@ref(appendix-impedance-analyisis)**). No transducer impedance measurements were made on other vessels prior to this survey.  

Next, the echosounder systems on each vessel were calibrated using the standard sphere technique [@Foote1987;@Demer2015]. On _`r survey.vessel`_, each WBT was calibrated in both CW (i.e., continuous wave or chirp mode) and FM modes (i.e., frequency modulation or broadband mode). The reference target was a `r cal.sphere` (`r cal.sphere.name`); calibrations of WBTs in FM mode used both the WC38.1 and a smaller 25-mm WC sphere. On each vessel, GPTs or WBTs were configured using the calibration results via the control software (EK80 `r ek80.version`, Simrad; see **Section \@ref(results-echosounder-calibration)**).  

### Data collection {#methods-acoustic-data-collection}  

Computer clocks were synchronized with the GPS clock (UTC) using synchronization software (NetTime^[http://timesynctool.com]). The 18-kHz GPT, operated by a separate PC from the other echosounders, was programmed to track the seabed and output the detected depth to the ship’s Scientific Computing System (SCS). The 38-, 70-, 120-, 200-, and 333-kHz echosounders were controlled by the ER60 Adaptive Logger [EAL^[https://swfsc.noaa.gov/eal/], @Renfree2016]. The EAL optimizes the pulse interval based on the seabed depth, while avoiding aliased seabed echoes, and was programmed such that once an hour the echosounders would operate in passive mode and record three pings, for obtaining estimates of the background noise level. The echosounder data from the USVs were erroneously timestamped (UTC+7 h), causing the correctly timestamped (UTC) navigation data to be mismatched. The erroneous timestamps were corrected in post-processing using the Fileset Time Offset parameter in Echoview. Acoustic sampling for CPS-density estimation along the pre-determined transects was limited to daylight hours (approximately between sunrise and sunset).  

Measurements of volume backscattering strength ($S_v$; dB re 1 m^2^ m^-3^) and target strength ($TS$, dB re 1 m^2^), indexed by time and geographic positions provided by GPS receivers, were logged to 60 m beyond the detected seabed range or to a maximum of `r raw.log.range` m and stored in Simrad .raw format with a `r raw.size`-MB maximum file size. During daytime and nighttime, the echosounders were set to operate in CW and FM modes, respectively. For each acoustic instrument, the prefix for the file name is a concatenation of the survey name (e.g.,  `r survey.name`), the operational mode (CW or FM), and the logging commencement date and time from the EK80 software. For example, a file generated by the Simrad EK80 software (`r ek80.version`) for a WBT operated in CW mode is named `1907RL-CW-D20190723-T125901.raw`.   

To minimize acoustic interference, transmit pulses from the EK60, EK80, ME70, MS70, SX90, and the acoustic Doppler current profiler (Ocean Surveyor Model OS75 ADCP, Teledyne RD Instruments) on _`r survey.vessel`_ were triggered using a synchronization system (K-Sync, Simrad). The K-Sync trigger rate, and thus echosounder ping interval, was modulated by the EAL using the 18-kHz seabed depth provided by the SCS. During daytime, the ME70, SX90, and ADCP were operated continuously, while the MS70 was only operated at times when CPS were present. At nighttime, only the EK60, EK80, and ADCP were operated. All other instruments that produce sound within the echosounder bandwidths were secured during daytime-survey operations. Exceptions were made during stations (e.g., plankton sampling and fish trawling) or in shallow water when the vessel's command occasionally operated the bridge's 50- and 200-kHz echosounders (Furuno), the Doppler velocity log (Model SRD-500A, Sperry Marine), or both. Transmit pulses from the survey echosounders and fishing sonars aboard _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_ were not synchronized.  

### Data processing {#methods-acoustic-data-processing}  

Echoes from schooling CPS and plankton (**Figs. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)a, d**) were identified using a semi-automated data processing algorithm implemented using Echoview software (`r ev.version`; Echoview Software Pty Ltd). The filters and thresholds were based on a subsample of echoes from randomly selected CPS schools. The aim of the filter criteria is to retain at least 95% of the noise-free backscatter from CPS while rejecting at least 95% of the non-CPS backscatter (**Fig. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)**). Data from _`r survey.vessel`_ and _Long Beach Carnage_ were processed using the following steps:  

1. Match geometry of the 70-, 120-, 200-, and 333-kHz $S_v$ to the 38-kHz $S_v$;
2. Remove passive-mode pings;
3. Estimate and subtract background noise using the background noise removal function [@DeRobertis2007] in Echoview (**Figs. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)b, e**);
4. Average the noise-free $S_v$ echograms using non-overlapping 11-sample by 3-ping bins;
5. Expand the averaged, noise-reduced _S~v~_ echograms with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation;
6. For each pixel, compute: $S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$, $S_{v,\mathrm{120kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$, and $S_{v,\mathrm{70kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$;
7. Create a Boolean echogram for $S_v$ differences in the CPS range: $-13.85 < S_{v,\mathrm{70kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 9.89 \text{ and} -13.5 < S_{v,\mathrm{120kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 9.37 \text{ and} -13.51 < S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 12.53$;
8. Compute the 120- and 200-kHz Variance-to-Mean Ratios [$VMR_{\mathrm{120kHz}}$ and $VMR_{\mathrm{200kHz}}$, respectively, @Demer2009] using the difference between noise-filtered $S_v$ (Step 3) and averaged $S_v$ (Step 4);
9. Expand the $VMR_{\mathrm{120kHz}}$ and $VMR_{\mathrm{200kHz}}$ echograms with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation;
10. Create a Boolean echogram based on the $VMR$s in the CPS range: $VMR_{\mathrm{120kHz}}$ > -65 dB and $VMR_{\mathrm{200kHz}}$ > -65 dB. Diffuse backscattering layers have low $VMR$ [@Zwolinski2010] whereas fish schools have high $VMR$ [@Demer2009];
11. Intersect the two Boolean echograms to create an echogram with "TRUE" samples for candidate CPS schools and "FALSE" elsewhere;
12. Mask the noise-reduced echograms using the CPS Boolean echogram (**Figs. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)c, f**);
13. Create an integration-start line `r int.start` m below the transducer (~10 m depth);
14. Create an integration-stop line `r adz.range` m above the estimated seabed [@Demer2009], or to the maximum logging range (e.g., `r int.stop` m), whichever is shallowest;
15. Set the minimum $S_v$ threshold to -60 dB (corresponding to a density of approximately three 20-cm-long Pacific Sardine per 100 m^3^);
16. Integrate the volume backscattering coefficients ($s_V$, m^2^ m^-3^) attributed to CPS over 5-m depths and averaged over 100-m distances;
17. Output the resulting nautical area scattering coefficients ($s_A$; m^2^ nmi^-2^) and associated information from each transect and frequency to comma-delimited text (.csv) files.

Data from _Lisa Marie_ were processed using the following steps:  

1. Remove shorter-duration, transient noise (e.g., ship’s asynchronous sonar) using the Impulse Noise Removal operator;
2. Remove longer-duration, transient noise (e.g., wave-hull collisions) using the Transient Noise Removal operator;
3. Compensate attenuated signals (e.g., from air-bubble attenuation) using the Attenuated Signal Removal operator;
4. Average the noise-free $S_v$ echograms using non-overlapping 11-sample by 3-ping bins;
5. Compute the $VMR$ using the difference between noise-filtered $S_v$ (Step 3) and averaged $S_v$ (Step 4);
6. Create a Boolean echogram mask using $VMR$ > -48 dB;
7. Expand the Boolean mask with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation;
8. Performs Steps 12-17 from `r survey.vessel` processing.
9. Data from the USVs were processed using the following:
10. Match geometry of the $S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}$ to the $S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$;
11. Remove passive-mode pings;
12. Perform Steps 3-5 from `r survey.vessel` processing;
13. For each pixel, compute: $S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$;
14. Create a Boolean echogram for $S_v$ differences in the CPS range: $-3 < S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}} < 9.37$
15. Perform Steps 8-9 from `r survey.vessel` processing;
16. Create a Boolean echogram mask using $VMR$ > -57 dB;
17. Performs Steps 11-17 from `r survey.vessel` processing.  

Data from the USVs were processed using the following steps:

When necessary, the start and stop integration lines were manually edited to exclude reverberation due to bubbles, to include the entirety of shallow CPS aggregations, or to exclude seabed echoes.

## Trawl sampling {#methods-trawl-sampling}  

During the day, CPS form schools, typically in the upper mixed layer [to 70-m depth in the spring; @Kim2005], and generally shallower in summer. After sunset, CPS schools tend to ascend and disperse; at that time, with reduced visibility and no schooling behavior, they are less able to avoid a net [@Mais1974]. Therefore, trawl sampling for identifying the species composition and length distributions of acoustic targets was performed at night.  

The net, a Nordic 264 rope trawl (NET Systems; Bainbridge Island, WA; **Figs. \@ref(fig:trawl-diagrams)a, b**), has a rectangular opening in the fishing portion of the net with an area of approximately 300 m^2^ (~15-m tall x 20-m wide), variable-sized mesh in the throat, an 8-mm square-mesh cod-end liner (to retain a large range of animal sizes), and a "marine mammal excluder device" to prevent the capture of large animals, such as dolphins, turtles, or sharks [@Dotson2010]. The trawl doors are foam-filled and the trawl headrope is lined with floats so the trawl tows at the surface.  

Up to three nighttime (i.e., 60 min after sunset to 30 min before sunrise) surface trawls, typically spaced 5-10 nmi-apart, were conducted in areas where echoes or eggs from putative CPS schools were observed earlier that day. Each evening, trawl locations were selected by an acoustician who monitored CPS echoes and a member of the trawl group who measured the densities of CPS eggs in CUFES samples. The locations were provided to the watch officers who charted the proposed trawl sites. Trawl locations were selected using the following criteria, in descending priority: CPS schools in echograms that day, CPS eggs in CUFES samples that day, and the trawl locations and catches during the previous night. If no CPS echoes or CPS eggs were observed along the transect(s) that day, the trawls were alternatively placed nearshore one night and offshore the next night, with consideration given to the seabed depth and the modeled distribution of Pacific Sardine habitat.  

Trawls were towed at ~4 kn for 45 min. The total catch from each trawl was weighed and sorted by species or groups. From the catches with CPS, up to 50 fish were selected randomly for each of the target species. Those were weighed and measured to either their standard length ($L_S$; mm) for Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy, or fork length ($L_F$; mm) for Jack Mackerel, Pacific Mackerel, and Pacific Herring. In addition, sex and maturity were recorded for up to 50 specimens from all species. Ovaries were preserved for up to 10 specimens of each CPS species except Pacific Herring. Fin clips were removed from 50 Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy specimens each from five different geographic zones (designated by J. Hyde and M. Craig, SWFSC) and preserved in ethanol for genetic analysis. Otoliths were removed from all 50 Pacific Sardine in the subsample; for other CPS species, 25 otoliths were removed from other CPS species "as equally as possible" from the range of sizes present. The combined catches in up to three trawls per night (i.e., trawl cluster) were used to estimate the proportions of species contributing to the nearest samples of acoustic backscatter.  

## Purse seine sampling {#methods-seine-sampling}  

Purse seines were set to provide information about size, age, and species composition of fishes observed in the echosounders mounted on the fishing vessels that sampled the nearshore region. _Lisa Marie_ used an approximately 440 m-long and 40 m-deep net with 17 mm-wide mesh (A. Blair, pers. comm.). _Long Beach Carnage_ used an approximately 200 m-long and 27 m-deep net with 17 mm-wide mesh; a small section on the back end of the net had 25 mm-wide mesh (R. Ashley, pers. comm.). All specimens collected by _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_ were frozen and later processed by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) or California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), respectively.  

On _Lisa Marie_, as many as three purse seine sets were planned each day. For each set, three dip net samples, spatially separated as much as possible, were collected. For each dip net sample, Pacific Sardine, Northern Anchovy, Jack Mackerel, Pacific Mackerel, and Pacific Herring were sorted, weighed, and counted to provide a combined weight and count for each species. Next, all three dip net samples were combined and up to 50 specimens were randomly sampled to provide a combined weight for each set. The length (mm; $L_S$ for Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy and $L_F$ for all others) and weight was measured for up to 25 randomly selected specimens of each species. Otoliths were extracted, macroscopic maturity stage was determined visually, and gonads were collected and preserved from female specimens.

On _Long Beach Carnage_, a maximum of one set per day was planned during daylight hours. In the event of abundant CPS or an unsuccessful daytime set, a set was made at night. For each set, three dip net samples, spatially separated as much as possible, were collected, and specimens were frozen for later analysis by CDFW biologists. The total weight (tons) of the school was estimated by the captain. After the survey, each dip net sample was sorted, weighed, and counted to provide a combined weight and count for each species. Next, all three dip net samples were combined and up to 50 specimens were randomly sampled to provide a combined weight for each set. The length (mm; $L_S$ for Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy and $L_F$ for all others) and weight was measured for up to 50 randomly selected specimens of each species. Otoliths were extracted and macroscopic maturity stage was determined visually. Since samples were frozen, no gonad samples from female specimens were analyzed.

## Ichthyoplankton and oceanographic sampling {#methods-other-sampling}
### Egg and larva sampling {#methods-egg-sampling}  

During the day, fish eggs were collected using a CUFES [@Checkley1997], which collects water and plankton at a rate of ~640 l min^-1^ from an intake on the hull of the ship at ~3-m depth. The particles in the sampled water were sieved by a 505-$\mu$m mesh. Pacific Sardine, Northern Anchovy, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Hake (_Merluccius productus_) eggs were identified to species, counted, and logged. Eggs from other species (e.g., Pacific Mackerel and flatfishes) were also counted and logged as "other fish eggs". Typically, the duration of each CUFES sample was 30 min, corresponding to a distance of 5 nmi at a speed of 10 kn. Because the durations of the initial egg stages is short for most CPS, the egg distributions inferred from CUFES samples indicate the nearby presence of actively spawning fish.  

A CalCOFI bongo oblique net [a bridleless pair of 71-cm diameter nets with 505-$\mu$m mesh; @Smith1977] was used opportunistically to sample ichthyoplankton and krill after sunset, to contribute to the CalCOFI ichthyoplankton time series. Where there was adequate depth, 300 m of wire was deployed at a rate of 50 m min^-1^ and then retrieved at 20 m min^-1^, at a nominal wire angle of 45$^\circ$. Bongo samples were stored in 5% buffered formalin.  

### Conductivity and temperature versus depth (CTD) sampling {#methods-ctd-sampling}  

Conductivity and temperature were measured versus depth to `r ctd.depth` m using calibrated sensors on a CTD rosette or underway probe (UnderwayCTD, or UCTD; Teledyne Oceanscience) cast from the vessel. These data were used to estimate the time-averaged sound speed [@Demer2004c], for estimating ranges to the sound scatterers, and frequency-specific sound absorption coefficients, for compensating signal attenuation of the sound pulse between the transducer and scatterers [@Simmonds2005]. These data indicate the depth of the surface mixed layer, above which most epipelagic CPS reside during the day, which is later used to determine the integration-stop depth during acoustic data processing.

# Results {#results}
## Echosounder calibrations {#results-echosounder-calibration}  

For _`r survey.vessel`_, the EK80s were calibrated between `r cal.datetime` while the vessel was alongside the pier near `r cal.loc` (`r cal.lat.dd` $^\circ$N, `r cal.lon.dd` $^\circ$W). Measurements of sea-surface temperature ($t_w$ = `r cal.temp` $^\circ$C) and salinity ($s_w$ = `r cal.sal` psu) were measured to a depth of 10 m using a handheld probe (Pro2030, YSI) and input to the WBT-control software (EK80 `r ek80.version`, Simrad), which derived estimates of sound speed ($c_w$ = `r cal.c` m s^-1^) and absorption coefficients (see **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results)**). Varying with tide, the seabed was approximately `r cal.min.z` to `r cal.max.z` m beneath the transducers. The calibration spheres were positioned in the far-field of each transducer, at 3.5- to 7-m range. WBT information, settings, and calibration results are presented in **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results)**. Measurements of beam-compensated sphere target strength relative to the theoretical target strength ($TS_{rel}$, dB re 1 m^2^) are presented in **Fig. \@ref(fig:tsc-plot)**. Measurements of gain, beamwidth, and offset angles from WBTs operated in FM mode are presented in **Fig. \@ref(fig:cal-plot-fm)**. During the impedance measurements with the centerboard in the retracted position, and later confirmed during calibration, one quadrant of the 18-kHz transducer appeared to be dysfunctional. An examination of impedance measurements made during the survey with the centerboard in the extended position indicated that the transducer may have been functional. Therefore, the results of the last known good calibration of the 18-kHz transducer, from the 2018 Summer CCE survey, are presented in **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results)**.  

For _Lisa Marie_, the 38-kHz GPT was calibrated using the standard sphere technique with a WC38.1 on 8 May while the vessel was anchored in Grays Harbor (46.9236, -124.1181). Two excursions of the WC38.1 sphere throughout the transducer beam were performed, then both excursions were combined and processed using EK80 software. Calibration results for _Lisa Marie_ are presented in **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results-lm)**.  

For _Long Beach Carnage_, the echosounders were calibrated using the standard sphere technique with a WC38.1 in a tank at the SWFSC. Beam model results were entered into the GPT-control software and are presented in **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results-lbc)**.  

For the three USVs, the echosounders were calibrated while dockside by Saildrone, Inc. using the standard sphere technique with a WC38.1. The results were processed and derived by the SWFSC [@Renfree2019], and are presented in **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results-sd)**.  

(ref:tsc-plot) Relative beam-compensated target strength ($TS_{rel}$, dB re 1 m^2^) measurements of a WC38.1 sphere at `r echo.freqs` kHz. $TS_{rel}$ is calculated as the difference between the beam-compensated target strength ($TS_c$) and the theoretical target strength ($TS_{theory}$, see **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results)**). Data for the 18-kHz transducer are from the last known good calibration prior to the 2018 Summer CCE survey. Crosses indicate measurements marked as outliers after viewing the beam model results.

During the 77-day survey, _`r survey.vessel`_ traveled 13,360 nmi, burned 476,500 l of diesel and, at 2.6817 kg l^-1^, emitted ~16,595 kg d^-1^ for a total CO~2~ footprint of ~1,277,830 kg (pers. comm., CAPT Chad Cary).  

**Leg I**  
On 13 June, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from the Exploratorium (Pier 15) in San Francisco, CA at ~1800 (all times UTC) and began the transit to northern Vancouver Island. Throughout the transit, sampling was conducted during the day with the CUFES, EK60s, EK80s, ME70, MS70 and SX90. On 17 June, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the first offshore station off Cape Scott, British Columbia at ~1230 to begin acoustic sampling along transect 129. On 1 July, acoustic sampling ceased after the completion of transect 84 off Newport, OR. On 2 July, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the Marine Operations-Pacific (MOC-P) Pier in Newport at ~2100 to complete Leg I.  

During Leg I (from 20 June to 1 July), _`r survey.vessel`_ coordinated with _Lisa Marie_, which sampled the nearshore region between Cape Flattery, WA and the OR-CA border. On 21 June, Greg Shaughnessy (Ocean Gold Seafoods) embarked _`r survey.vessel`_ to observe survey operations. At the same time, Josiah Renfree boarded _Lisa Marie_ to remedy minor issues with the echosounder before rejoining _`r survey.vessel`_. At ~1900 on 25 June, Mr. Shaughnessy disembarked and was put ashore in Westport, WA via _`r survey.vessel`_'s skiff.  

During Legs I through III (from 20 June to 24 August), one USV (SD-1047) conducted daytime acoustic sampling in the nearshore region between Cape Flattery and Pt. Conception. Between approximately Tillamook, OR and Pt. Arena, CA, transects were sampled at 10-nmi spacing to allow the USV to catch-up to _`r survey.vessel`_.  

**Leg II**  
On 8 July, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from MOC-P Pier in Newport, OR, at ~0000. Acoustic sampling resumed at ~0145 on 8 July along transect 083 south of Newport, OR. On 24 July, acoustic sampling ceased after the completion of transect 050 off Albion, CA. On 25 July, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at Pier 30/32 in San Francisco, CA at ~1300 to complete Leg II. 

During Legs II and III (from 9 July to 6 August), two USVs (SD-1045 and SD-1046) conducted daytime acoustic sampling at 80-nmi spacing in the offshore region between approximately Florence and Pt. Conception. From 6 to 12 August, one USV (SD-1046) conducted daytime acoustic sampling at 40-nmi spacing in the offshore region between approximately Pt. Conception and San Diego.  

**Leg III**  

On 30 July, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from Pier 30/32 in San Francisco at ~1300 and transited to transect 049 north of the Point Arena lighthouse. Trawling was conducted during the evening of 30 July, prior to resuming acoustic sampling along transect 049 on 31 July. Intermittent malfunctions of the trawl winch encoders reduced trawl sampling from 1-2 August. Increased malfunctions of the trawl-winch encoders prohibited trawling from 3-6 August. On 6 August, the trawl winches were repaired and normal sampling resumed. On 16 August, acoustic sampling ceased after the completion of transect 023 off Morro Bay. On 17 August, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego, CA at ~1400 to complete Leg III.  

\newpage  

**Leg IV**

On 22 August, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego at ~1500. Training on the ship’s dynamic-positioning system was performed in San Diego Harbor until ~2000, after which _`r survey.vessel`_ transited to transect 019 off Pismo Beach. On 23 August, at ~1700, _`r survey.vessel`_ deployed a benthic acoustic lander off Pt. Conception, then resumed acoustic sampling along transect 019 at ~1800. On 1 September, _`r survey.vessel`_'s fog horn was repaired using parts received from ashore via skiff. At ~1500 on 1 September, the UCTD probe was lost when a vessel running parallel to the ship turned across the stern and severed the line. At ~0200 on 7 September, acoustic sampling ceased after the completion of transect 001 off San Diego. _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego at ~2100 on 8 September to complete the survey.  

During Leg IV (from 26 August to 6 September), _`r survey.vessel`_ coordinated sampling with _Long Beach Carnage_ in the Southern CA Bight between Pt. Conception and San Diego and around Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands.  

### Ichthyoplankton and oceanographic sampling {#results-other-sampling}  

A total of `r nrow(ctd.sta)` CTD casts and `r nrow(bongo.sta)` bongo tows were conducted throughout the survey. In addition, `r nrow(uctd.sta)` UCTD casts were conducted and `r prettyNum(nrow(cufes.raw), digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` CUFES samples were collected underway. The locations of CTD and UCTD stations are presented in **Fig. \@ref(fig:station-sampling)** and **Appendix \@ref(appendix-ctd-sampling)**.  

## Distribution of CPS {#results-cps-distribution}
### Core region  

Acoustic backscatter ascribed to CPS (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)a**)  was observed throughout the survey area, but was most prevalent off southwest Vancouver Island and Cape Flattery; nearshore between the Columbia River and Cape Mendocino; and throughout the entire survey area between Cape Blanco and San Diego.  

Northern Anchovy eggs were abundant in CUFES samples nearshore off the Columbia River; offshore north of Newport; and offshore between approximately San Francisco and Morro Bay (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)b**). Pacific Sardine eggs were abundant nearshore between the Columbia River and Cape Blanco; and offshore between Cape Blanco and Cape Mendocino (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)b**). Jack Mackerel eggs were observed between approximately Newport and Cape Mendocino, offshore between approximately San Francisco and Morro Bay, and in the southern portion of the SCB (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)b**). Between Newport and Cape Mendocino, Jack Mackerel eggs were coincident with Pacific Sardine eggs (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)b**).  

Pacific Herring catches were predominant, by weight, in trawl samples collected off Vancouver Island and nearshore off WA, north of the Columbia River (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**). Jack Mackerel dominated the trawl catches between approximately Newport and Bodega Bay (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**). Northern Anchovy was the predominant species in trawl catches between Bodega Bay and San Diego. Pacific Sardine were caught in relatively small numbers between the Columbia River and Cape Mendocino, near Bodega Bay, and around the northern Channel Islands in the SCB (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**). A few Pacific Mackerel were caught along the OR and northern CA coasts, and offshore near Bodega Bay and Pt. Conception (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**). Overall, the `r nrow(trawl.summ)` trawls captured a combined `r prettyNum(haul.CPS.kg, digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` kg of CPS (`r prettyNum(haul.Sardine.kg, digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` kg Pacific Sardine, `r prettyNum(haul.Anchovy.kg, digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` kg Northern Anchovy, `r prettyNum(haul.JackMack.kg, digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` kg Jack Mackerel, `r prettyNum(haul.PacMack.kg, digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` kg Pacific Mackerel, and `r prettyNum(haul.PacHerring.kg, digits = 1, big.mark = ",")` kg Pacific Herring; **Appendix \@ref(appendix-trawl-sampling)**).  

### Nearshore region  

Off the WA and OR coasts, acoustic backscatter sampled by _Lisa Marie_ and ascribed to CPS was most prevalent near the Columbia River and around Newport (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lm)a**). Off the coasts of WA, OR, and CA, acoustic backscatter sampled by the nearshore USV and ascribed to CPS was most prevalent near the Columbia River; off San Francisco Bay; and between Carmel, CA and Morro Bay (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-trawl-sd)a**). In the SCB, acoustic backscatter sampled by _Long Beach Carnage_ and ascribed to CPS was observed throughout the nearshore survey area, but was most prevalent between Santa Barbara and Malibu; and between Costa Mesa and La Jolla (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lbc)a**).  

Pacific Herring catches were predominant, by weight, in purse seine and trawl samples collected between Cape Flattery and Newport (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lm)b**, **Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-trawl-sd)b**). Jack Mackerel dominated the purse seine catches between approximately Newport and the OR-CA border (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lm)b**), and trawl samples between approximately Newport and Bodega Bay (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-trawl-sd)b**). Northern Anchovy were present in four purse seines set by _Lisa Marie_ and one set by _Long Beach Carnage_, but were most abundant north of the Columbia River (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lm)b**). In trawl samples, Northern Anchovy were the predominant species caught between Bodega Bay and San Diego (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-trawl-sd)b**). A few Pacific Sardine were caught in purse seine samples between the Columbia River and Newport (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lm)b**) and in trawl samples collected between the Columbia River and Cape Mendocino (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-trawl-sd)b**), but Pacific Sardine dominated the purse seine samples collected throughout the SCB (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lbc)b**). A few Pacific Mackerel were caught in trawl samples collected along the OR and northern CA coasts (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-trawl-sd)b**) and in purse seine samples collected in the SCB near Anacapa Island and Long Beach (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-seine-lbc)b**).  

### Offshore region  

Acoustic backscatter ascribed to CPS in the offshore region was generally greatest along the innermost portions of transects conducted between approximately Cape Mendocino and San Francisco, and in the SCB off San Clemente Island and San Diego (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-offshore)**). Jack Mackerel eggs were predominant in the offshore region and in most cases extended to the ends of the 100 nmi-long transect extensions (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)b**). Some Pacific Sardine eggs were also present in offshore transects off central CA. Six trawl samples were collected in the offshore region; four with CPS in the catch. Of those that contained CPS, Jack Mackerel were most abundant, with some Pacific Mackerel and Pacific Sardine also present (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**).

# Discussion {#discussion}  

The principal objectives of the `r survey.das`-day, Summer 2019 CCE Survey were to survey the northern stock of Pacific Sardine and the northern and central stocks of Northern Anchovy. Then, as possible, survey Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, Pacific Herring, and the southern stock of Pacific Sardine. With the benefit of favorable weather and few technical problems, _`r survey.vessel`_ surveyed the entire planned area from the northern end of Vancouver Island to San Diego. South of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, all transects were spaced `r adaptive.spacing`-nmi apart. The coordinated sampling with fishing vessels and USVs expanded the survey area into previously unsampled regions.  

The combined use of NOAA ships, fishing vessels, and USVs to conduct ATM surveys of CPS identified several advantages and disadvantages, which are elaborated below from the perspective of the SWFSC's Advanced Survey Technologies Group. 

## Advantages {#discussion-advantages}  

+ Two USVs sampled acoustic transects offshore, where wind was ample, provided sampling that was coincident with that from _`r survey.vessel`_, and increased the collection of acoustic backscatter data throughout approximately two-thirds of the survey area;
+ Fishing vessels extended the echosounder and net-catch data to nearshore areas where _`r survey.vessel`_ could not safely navigate nor trawl. With coordination, the sampling from _`r survey.vessel`_ was concomitant with sampling from _Lisa Marie_ off WA and OR, and from _Long Beach Carnage_ off SCB.  

## Disadvantages {#discussion-disadvantages}  

+ The USV sampled acoustic transects nearshore, where wind was often light and variable, but had difficulty navigating and progressed slowly along the coasts of WA and OR compared to the offshore USVs, and therefore was less coincident with sampling from _`r survey.vessel`_;
+ The fishing vessels and USVs sampled with fewer echosounder frequencies than _`r survey.vessel`_. Consequently, there were differences in the acoustic data processing that may affect the identification of CPS echoes.

# Echosounder transducer impedance measurements {#appendix-impedance-analyisis}  
## All transducers
As part of the echosounder calibrations aboard the NOAA Ship _Lasker_, the impedance of each quadrant of each transducer was measured with the transducers in air (centerboard in maintenance position) and water (centerboard in retracted position). The complex impedance was measured using a Precision LCR Meter (E4980A, Agilent) at 201 frequencies spanning a user-specified bandwidth, and automated using a computer-controlled, custom-made multiplexer that switches the individual transducer quadrants between an echosounder and the LCR meter (**Fig. \@ref(fig:impedance-plots)**).  

(ref:impedance-plots) The magnitude of impedance ($|Z|$, $\Omega$; panel a), phase ($\theta$, $^\circ$; panel b), and conductance ($G$, $S$; panel c) versus frequency, and susceptance ($B$, $S$) versus $G$ (admittance circle; panel d), for each transducer quadrant (various colors) measured in water at the time of calibration.

\newpage

The impedance measurements indicated that quadrant 1 of the 18-kHz transducer (ES18, Simrad) was faulty (**Fig. \@ref(fig:impedance-plots)**, top left). To rule out the possibility that the fault was caused by the multiplexer, repeated measurements were obtained with the transducer connected: (1) through the multiplexer, (2) directly through the transducer’s Amphenol connector, and (3) directly to the quadrant 1 wires on the transducer cable. In all cases, the quadrant 1 impedance was abnormal. The following describes the measurements conducted.  

## Fault isolation
### Air measurements  

On 30 April, with the centerboard in the maintenance position (i.e., transducers in air), impedance measurements were obtained for all quadrants of the ES18 with the transducer connected through the custom-made multiplexer (**Fig. \@ref(fig:impedance-es18-air)**). At 18 kHz, the magnitudes of impedance for quadrants 1-4 were 8.4 $\mathrm{k}\Omega$, 10.9 $\Omega$, 10.9 $\Omega$, and 9.9 $\Omega$, respectively.

```  

\newpage

### Water measurements
#### Through multiplexer 

On 1 May, the centerboard was lowered to the retracted position — placing the transducers in water — and impedance was again measured for all quadrants of the ES18 with the transducer connected through the multiplexer (**Fig. \@ref(fig:impedance-es18-water-zmux)**). At 18 kHz, the magnitudes of impedance for quadrants 1-4 were 8.4 $\mathrm{k}\Omega$, 74.3 $\Omega$, 67.2 $\Omega$, and 68.7 $\Omega$, respectively.

```

\newpage

#### Directly to Amphenol connector

The LCR meter was then connected directly to quadrant 1 of the ES18 on the transducer’s Amphenol connector (Pins H and J) and impedance measurements obtained (**Fig. \@ref(fig:impedance-es18-water-amphenol)**). At 18 kHz, the magnitude of impedance for quadrant 1 was 8.2 $\mathrm{k}\Omega$.

```


\newpage  

#### Directly to transducer wires  

The transducer’s Amphenol connector was then disassembled and the LCR meter connected directly to the quadrant 1 wires, then impedance measurements were obtained (**Fig. \@ref(fig:impedance-es18-water-direct)**). At 18 kHz, the magnitude of impedance for quadrant 1 was 5.4 $\mathrm{k}\Omega$.
