# Executive Summary {-}

This report provides: 1) a detailed description of the acoustic-trawl method (ATM) used by NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) for direct assessments of the dominant species of coastal pelagic species (CPS; i.e., Pacific Sardine _Sardinops sagax_, Northern Anchovy _Engraulis mordax_, Pacific Mackerel _Scomber japonicus_, Jack Mackerel _Trachurus symmetricus_, and Pacific Herring _Clupea pallasii_) in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) off the west coast of North America; and 2) estimates of the biomasses, distributions, and demographies of those CPS in the survey area between `r survey.start` and `r survey.end` `r survey.year`. The survey area spanned most of the continental shelf between the northern tip of Vancouver Island, British Columbia (BC) and San Diego, CA. Throughout the survey area, NOAA Ship _`r survey.vessel.long`_ (hereafter, _`r survey.vessel`_) sampled along transects oriented approximately perpendicular to the coast, from the shallowest navigable depth (~30 m depth) to either a distance of 35 nmi or to the 1,000 fathom (~1830 m) isobath, whichever is farthest.  

For the survey area and period, the estimated biomass of the northern stock (or sub-population) of Northern Anchovy was `r prettyNum(be.all$Biomass[be.all$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all$lower.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all$upper.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t, CV = `r prettyNum(be.all$biomass.cv[be.all$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%). The northern stock ranged from approximately Westport, WA to Coos Bay, OR and standard length ($L_S$) ranged from `r length.summ$L.min[length.summ$scientificName == 'Engraulis mordax' & length.summ$stock == 'Northern']` to `r length.summ$L.max[length.summ$scientificName == 'Engraulis mordax' & length.summ$stock == 'Northern']` cm with modes at 15 and 17 cm.  

The estimated biomass of the central stock of Northern Anchovy was `r prettyNum(be.all$Biomass[be.all$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all$Stock == "Central"],big.mark=",",digits=4)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all$lower.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all$Stock == "Central"],big.mark=",",digits=4)` - `r prettyNum(be.all$upper.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all$Stock == "Central"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t, CV = `r prettyNum(be.all$biomass.cv[be.all$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all$Stock == "Central"],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%). The central stock ranged from approximately Fort Bragg to San Diego, CA and $L_S$ ranged from `r length.summ$L.min[length.summ$scientificName == 'Engraulis mordax' & length.summ$stock == 'Central']` to `r length.summ$L.max[length.summ$scientificName == 'Engraulis mordax' & length.summ$stock == 'Central']` cm with modes at 8 and 12 cm.  

The estimated biomass of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine was `r prettyNum(be.all$Biomass[be.all$Species == 'Sardinops sagax' & be.all$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all$lower.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Sardinops sagax' & be.all$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all$upper.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Sardinops sagax' & be.all$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t, CV = `r prettyNum(be.all$biomass.cv[be.all$Species == 'Sardinops sagax' & be.all$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%). The northern stock ranged from approximately Astoria, OR to Morro Bay, CA. $L_S$ ranged from `r length.summ$L.min[length.summ$scientificName == 'Sardinops sagax' & length.summ$stock == 'Northern']` to `r length.summ$L.max[length.summ$scientificName == 'Sardinops sagax' & length.summ$stock == 'Northern']` cm with modes at 17 and 24 cm.  

The estimated biomass of the southern stock of Pacific Sardine was `r prettyNum(be.all$Biomass[be.all$Species == 'Sardinops sagax' & be.all$Stock == "Southern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all$lower.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Sardinops sagax' & be.all$Stock == "Southern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all$upper.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Sardinops sagax' & be.all$Stock == "Southern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t, CV = `r prettyNum(be.all$biomass.cv[be.all$Species == 'Sardinops sagax' & be.all$Stock == "Southern"],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%). The southern stock ranged from approximately Pt. Conception to San Diego. $L_S$ ranged from `r length.summ$L.min[length.summ$scientificName == 'Sardinops sagax' & length.summ$stock == 'Southern']` to `r length.summ$L.max[length.summ$scientificName == 'Sardinops sagax' & length.summ$stock == 'Southern']` cm with a mode at 16 cm.  

The estimated biomass of Pacific Mackerel was `r prettyNum(be.all$Biomass[be.all$Species == 'Scomber japonicus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all$lower.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Scomber japonicus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all$upper.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Scomber japonicus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t, CV = `r prettyNum(be.all$biomass.cv[be.all$Species == 'Scomber japonicus'],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%). Pacific Mackerel ranged from approximately Astoria to Cape Mendocino, and from Morro Bay to San Diego. Fork length ($L_F$) ranged from `r length.summ$L.min[length.summ$scientificName == 'Scomber japonicus']` to `r length.summ$L.max[length.summ$scientificName == 'Scomber japonicus']` cm with a modes at 8 and 32 cm.  

The estimated biomass of Jack Mackerel was `r prettyNum(be.all$Biomass[be.all$Species == 'Trachurus symmetricus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all$lower.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Trachurus symmetricus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all$upper.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Trachurus symmetricus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t, CV = `r prettyNum(be.all$biomass.cv[be.all$Species == 'Trachurus symmetricus'],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%). Jack Mackerel ranged from approximately Westport to Bodega Bay, and from Morro Bay to San Diego. Fork length ($L_F$) ranged from `r length.summ$L.min[length.summ$scientificName == 'Trachurus symmetricus']` to `r length.summ$L.max[length.summ$scientificName == 'Trachurus symmetricus']` cm with modes at 7, 21-22, and 28-32 cm.  

The estimated biomass of Pacific Herring was `r prettyNum(be.all$Biomass[be.all$Species == 'Clupea pallasii'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all$lower.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Clupea pallasii'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all$upper.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Clupea pallasii'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t, CV = `r prettyNum(be.all$biomass.cv[be.all$Species == 'Clupea pallasii'],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%). Pacific Herring ranged from approximately Cape Scott, BC to Coos Bay and $L_F$ ranged from `r length.summ$L.min[length.summ$scientificName == 'Clupea pallasii']` to `r length.summ$L.max[length.summ$scientificName == 'Clupea pallasii']` cm with modes at 15 and 22 cm.  

To estimate the biomass of CPS in offshore areas that are not routinely sampled, _`r survey.vessel`_ and two USVs sampled along 100 nmi-long extensions of compulsory transects spaced 80 nmi-apart between Florence, OR and San Diego (**Appendix \@ref(appendix-biomass-os)**).  

To estimate the biomass of CPS in shallow, nearshore areas where sampling by _`r survey.vessel`_ is unsafe, two fishing vessels (F/Vs _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_) and one USV sampled along 5 nmi-long transects spaced 5 nmi-apart along the mainland coast between Cape Flattery and San Diego, and around Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Island in the Southern CA Bight (SCB) (**Appendix \@ref(appendix-biomass-ns)**).

<!-- **[Include?]** To investigate the potential biomass of CPS in areas where neither _`r survey.vessel`_ nor the USV could safely navigate, acoustically sampled biomass along the easternmost portions of transects were extrapolated to the 5-m isobath in the unsampled nearshore areas (**Appendix \@ref(appendix-biomass-nse)**).  -->

# Introduction {#introduction}
In the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), multiple coastal pelagic fish species (CPS; i.e., Pacific Sardine _Sardinops sagax_, Northern Anchovy _Engraulis mordax_, Jack Mackerel _Trachurus symmetricus_, Pacific Mackerel _Scomber japonicus_, and Pacific Herring _Clupea pallasii_) comprise the bulk of the forage fish assemblage. These populations that can change by an order of magnitude within a couple years, represent important prey for marine mammals, birds, and larger migratory fishes [@Field2001], and are targets of commercial fisheries.   

During summer and fall, the northern stock of Pacific Sardine typically migrates to feed in the productive coastal upwelling off Oregon, Washington, and Vancouver Island [@Zwolinski2012, and references therein, **Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-distribution)**]. The predominantly piscivorous adult Pacific and Jack Mackerels also migrate north in summer, but go farther offshore to feed [@Zwolinski2014 and references therein]. In the winter and spring, the Pacific Sardine stock typically migrates to their spawning grounds, generally off central and southern California [@Demer2012] and occasionally off Oregon and Washington [@Lo2011]. These migrations vary in extent with population sizes, fish ages and lengths, and oceanographic conditions. For example, the transition zone chlorophyll front [TZCF; @Polovina2001] may delineate the offshore and southern limit of both Pacific Sardine and Pacific Mackerel habitat [e.g., @Demer2012; @Zwolinski2012], and juveniles may have nursery areas in the Southern California Bight, downstream of upwelling regions. In contrast, Northern Anchovy spawn predominantly during winter and closer to the coast where seasonal down-welling increases retention of their eggs and larvae [@Bakun1982]. Pacific Herring spawn in intertidal beach areas [@Love1996]. The northern stock of Northern Anchovy is located off Washington and Oregon and the central stock is located off Central and Southern California. Whether a species migrates or remains in an area depends on its reproductive and feeding behaviors and affinity to certain oceanographic or seabed habitats.  

Acoustic-trawl method (ATM) surveys, which combine information collected with echosounders and nets, were introduced to the CCE more than 40 years ago to survey CPS off the west coast of the U.S. [@Mais1974;@Mais1977;@Smith1978]. Following a two-decade hiatus, the ATM was reintroduced in the CCE in spring 2006 to sample the then abundant Pacific Sardine population [@Cutter2008]. Since 2006, this sampling effort has continued and expanded through annual or semi-annual surveys [@Zwolinski2014]. Beginning in 2011, the ATM estimates of Pacific Sardine abundance, age structure, and distribution have been incorporated in the annual Pacific Sardine assessments [@Hill2017]. Additionally, ATM survey results are applied to estimate the abundances, demographies, and distributions of epipelagic and semi-demersal fishes [e.g., @Swartzman1997;@Williams2013;@Zwolinski2014] and plankton [@Hewitt2000].  

This document, and references herein, describes in detail the ATM as presently used by NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) to survey the distributions and abundances of CPS and their oceanographic environments [e.g., @Cutter2008;@Demer2012;@Zwolinski2014]. In general terms, the contemporary ATM combines information from satellite-sensed oceanographic conditions, calibrated multifrequency echosounders, probe-sampled oceanographic conditions, pumped samples of fish eggs, and trawl-net catches of juvenile and adult CPS. The survey area is initially defined with consideration to the potential habitat of a priority stock or stock assemblage, e.g., that for the northern stock of Pacific Sardine (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-distribution)**) or the central or northern stock other Northern Anchovy. The survey area is further expanded to encompass as much of the potential habitat as possible for other CPS present off the West Coast of the U.S., as time permits.  

Along transects in the survey area, multi-frequency split-beam echosounders transmit sound pulses downward beneath the ship and receive echoes from animals and the seabed in the path of the sound waves. Measurements of sound speed and absorption from conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) probes allow accurate compensation of these echoes for propagation losses. The calibrated echo intensities, normalized to the range-dependent observational volume, provide indications of the target type and behavior [e.g., @Demer2009].

(ref:sardine-distribution) Conceptual spring (shaded region) and summer (hashed region) distributions of potential habitat for the northern stock of Pacific Sardine along the west coasts of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The dashed and dotted lines represent, respectively, the approximate summer and spring positions of the 0.2 mg m^–3^ chlorophyll-a concentration isoline. This isoline appears to oscillate in synchrony with the transition zone chlorophyll front [TZCF, @Polovina2001] and the offshore limit of the northern stock Pacific Sardine potential habitat [@Zwolinski2011]. Mackerels are found within and on the edge of the same oceanographic  habitat [e.g., @Demer2012; @Zwolinski2012]. The TZCF may delineate the offshore and southern limit of both Pacific Sardine and Pacific Mackerel distributions, and juveniles may have nursery areas in the Southern California Bight (SCB), downstream of upwelling regions.

\newpage  

Echoes from marine organisms are a function of their body composition, shape, and size relative to the sensing-sound wavelength, and their orientation relative to the incident sound waves [@Cutter2009;@Demer2009;@Renfree2009]. Variations in echo intensity across frequencies, known as echo spectra, often indicate the taxonomic groups contributing to the echoes. The CPS, with highly reflective swim bladders, create high intensity echoes of sound pulses at all echosounder frequencies [e.g., @Conti2003]. In contrast, krill, with acoustic properties closer to those of the surrounding sea-water, produce lower intensity echoes, particularly at lower frequencies [e.g., @Demer2003]. The echo energy attributed to CPS, based on empirical echo spectra [@Demer2012], are apportioned to species using trawl-catch proportions [@Zwolinski2014].  

Animal densities are estimated by dividing the summed intensities attributed to a species by the length-weighted average echo intensity (the mean backscattering cross-section) from animals of that species [e.g., @Demer2012]. Transects with similar densities are grouped into post-sampling strata that mimic the natural patchiness of the target species [e.g., @Zwolinski2014]. An estimate of abundance is obtained by multiplying the average estimated density in the stratum by the stratum area [@Demer2012]. The associated sampling variance is calculated using non-parametric bootstrap of the mean transect densities. The total abundance estimate in the survey area is the sum of abundances in all strata. Similarly, the total variance estimate is the sum of the variance in each stratum.  

The primary objectives of the SWFSC’s ATM surveys are to survey the distributions and abundances of CPS, krill, and their abiotic environments in the CCE. Typically, spring surveys are conducted during 25-40 days-at-sea (DAS) between March and May, and summer surveys are conducted during 50-80 DAS between June and October. In spring, the ATM surveys focus primarily on the northern stock of Pacific Sardine and the central stock of Northern Anchovy. In summer, the ATM surveys also focus on the northern stock of Northern Anchovy. During spring and summer, the biomasses of other CPS (e.g., Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Herring) present in the survey area are estimated.  

In `r tolower(survey.season)` `r survey.year`, an ATM survey was performed aboard NOAA Ship _`r survey.vessel.long`_ (hereafter, _`r survey.vessel`_) to sample the west coast of North America, from the northern tip of Vancouver Island, British Columbia (BC) to San Diego, to estimate the biomass distributions and demographies of the CPS assemblage in the CCE, together with their biotic and abiotic habitats. The ATM survey was part of a larger, collaborative survey that used coordinated sampling by fishing vessels and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to estimate the biomass of CPS in offshore and nearshore regions where sampling by _`r survey.vessel`_ was not possible or unsafe.  

Presented here are 1) a detailed description of the ATM used to survey CPS in the CCE off the west coast of North America; and 2) estimates of the abundance, biomass, size structure, and distribution of CPS, specifically the northern and southern stock of Pacific Sardine; the northern and central stock of Northern Anchovy; Pacific Mackerel; Jack Mackerel; and Pacific Herring for the primary survey area and period. Estimates of the abundance, biomass, size structure, and distribution of CPS in the offshore and nearshore survey regions are presented in **Appendix \@ref(appendix-biomass-os)** and **Appendix \@ref(appendix-biomass-ns)**, respectively. Additional details about the the survey may be found in the survey report [@Stierhoff2019c].

# Methods {#methods}
## Data collection {#methods-data-collection}
### Survey design {#methods-survey-design}  
The `r tolower(survey.season)` `r survey.year` survey was conducted using _`r survey.vessel`_. The sampling domain, between `r survey.landmark.n` at the northern end of Vancouver Island and `r survey.landmark.s`, was defined by the modeled distribution of potential habitat for the northern stock of Pacific Sardine at the beginning of the survey (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-potential-habitat)a**), and information recently gathered rom other research projects (e.g., California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations [CalCOFI] samples) or the fishing industry (g.e., bycatch of Pacific Sardine). This area encompassed the anticipated distributions of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine and the central and notthern stocks of Northern Anchovy off the west coasts of the U.S. and Canada from approximately San Diego, CA to Cape Scott, BC, but also spanned portions of the southern stock of Pacific Sardine, Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Herring (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-potential-habitat)b-d**). East to west, the sampling domain extends from the coast to at least the 1,000 fathom (~1830 m) isobath [**Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**]. Considering the expected distribution of the target species, the acceptable uncertainty in biomass estimates, and the available ship time (`r survey.das` days at sea, DAS), the principal survey objectives were the estimations of biomass for the northern and southern stocks of Pacific Sardine and the northern and central stocks of Northern Anchovy. Additionally, biomass estimates were sought for Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Herring in the survey area.  

Additional sampling was conducted: 1) nearshore along 4-nmi-long transects spaced 5 nmi apart between San Francisco and Pt. Conception using a wind- and solar-powered unmanned surface vehicle (USV; Saildrone, Inc.) equipped with dual-frequency (38 and 200 kHz) echosounders (orange lines, **Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**); and 2) offshore by _`r survey.vessel`_ along seven ~100-nmi-long transects between central WA and Morro Bay (green lines, **Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**). The goal of the nearshore sampling was to estimate the abundance and biomass of the central stock of Northern Anchovy and northern stock of Pacific Sardine close to shore, in shallow water, or both, where sampling where _`r survey.vessel`_ could not safely navigate. The goal of the offshore sampling was to to estimate the abundance and biomass of CPS in areas not routinely sampled during past ATM surveys. Detailed methods from the offshore and nearshore sampling are presented in **Appendix \@ref(appendix-biomass-os-methods)** and **Appendix \@ref(appendix-biomass-ns-methods)**, respectively.   

Systematic surveys are used to estimate biomasses of clustered populations with strong geographical trends [@Fewster2009]. However, when sampling small, dispersed populations, systematic designs may oversample areas with low biomass. In these situations, the survey domain may be first surveyed with coarse resolution, and then sampling may be added in areas with the most biomass [@Manly2002]. This two-stage approach results in smaller estimates of variance compared to those from random systematic or fully random sampling designs [@Francis1984].  

The survey of CPS in the CCE merges the concepts of systematic and adaptive sampling designs in a novel, one-stage hybrid design. The survey includes a grid of compulsory, parallel transects spaced by either `r adaptive.spacing` or `r compulsory.spacing` nmi. The location of the `r adaptive.spacing`-nmi-spaced compulsory grid is decided a priori and applied in areas with high diversity and abundance during past surveys. The sampling intensity in the compulsory grid is fixed, constituting a systematic design. Elsewhere, the maximum transect spacing is `r compulsory.spacing` nmi, but transect spacing may be adaptively decreased where CPS echoes, eggs, or catches are observed in high densities. An adaptive event adds a minimum of three transects to the `r compulsory.spacing`-nmi-compulsory design to create a stratum with a minimum of seven contiguous `r adaptive.spacing`-nmi-spaced transects. 

During CPS surveys progressing from north to south, if CPS are observed during a compulsory `r compulsory.spacing`-nmi-spaced transect, an adaptive transect is added `r adaptive.spacing` nmi to the north. After completion of the first adaptive transect, a second one is added `r compulsory.spacing` nmi to the south. This is followed by a compulsory transect and then a third adaptive transect. If CPS are encountered on the following compulsory transect, then an additional adaptive transect is added. If not, the next compulsory transect is sampled. This approach is an efficient application of the available sampling effort to optimize the precision of estimated biomass for patchily distributed populations within the survey domain.  

Because the sampling density is adaptively increased in areas with CPS, the inherent sampling heterogeneity requires post-stratification (see **Section \@ref(methods-post-stratification)**). This combination of adaptive sampling and post-survey stratification reduces the sampling variance without introducing sampling bias. The transects are perpendicular to the coast, extending from the shallowest navigable depth (~30 m depth) to either a distance of 35 nmi or to the 1,000 fathom isobath, whichever is farthest (**Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**). When CPS are observed within the westernmost 3 nmi of a transect, that transect and the next one to the south are extended in 5-nmi increments until no CPS are observed in the last 3 nmi of the extension.

### Acoustic sampling {#methods-acoustic-sampling}
#### Acoustic equipment {#methods-acoustic-equipment} 
On _`r survey.vessel`_, multi-frequency EK60 General Purpose Transceivers (18 and 38 kHz GPTs; Simrad) and EK80 Wideband Transceivers (70, 120, 200, and 333 kHz WBTs; Simrad) were configured with split-beam transducers (`r echo.models`, respectively; Simrad). The transducers were mounted on the bottom of a retractable keel or "centerboard" (**Fig. \@ref(fig:cb-config)**). The keel was retracted (transducers ~`r cb.retracted`-m depth) during calibration, and extended to the intermediate position (transducers ~`r cb.intermediate`-m depth) during the survey. Exceptions were made during shallow water operations, when the keel was retracted; or during times of heavy weather, when the keel was extended (transducers ~`r cb.extended`-m depth) to provide extra stability and reduce the effect of weather-generated noise. In addition, acoustic data were also collected using an ME70 multibeam echosounder (Simrad), MS70 multibeam sonar (Simrad), and SX90 omni-directional sonar (Simrad). Transducer position and motion were measured at 5 Hz using an inertial motion unit (POS-MV, Trimble/Applanix).  

On the three USVs (SD-1045, SD-1046, and SD-1047), a miniature wideband transceiver (WBT-Mini, Simrad) was configured with a gimbaled, keel-mounted, dual-frequency transducer (ES38-18|200-18, Simrad). Both the split-beam 38-kHz and single-beam 200-kHz had nominally 18$^\circ$ beamwidths.  

(ref:cb-config) Echosounder transducers mounted on the bottom of the retractable centerboard on _`r survey.vessel`_. During the survey, the centerboard was extended, typically positioning the transducers at ~2-m below the keel at a water depth of ~7 m.

} else if (survey.vessel.primary == "SH") {
  include_graphics(here("Images/img_centerboard_config_SH.png"))
}
```  

#### Echosounder calibration {#methods-echosounder-calibration}  
First, the transducer integrities were verified through transducer-impedance measurements in water and air using an LCR meter (Agilent E4980A) and custom Matlab software. The impedance magnitude ($|Z|$, $\Omega$), phase ($\theta$, $^\circ$), conductance ($G$, $S$), susceptance ($B$, $S$), resistance ($R$, $\Omega$), and reactance ($X$, $\Omega$) were measured over broadband frequency ranges for each transducer quadrants connected in parallel. **[Add information about impedance measurements, or cite survey report?]**  

Next, the echosounder systems aboard _`r survey.vessel`_ were calibrated between `r cal.datetime` while the vessel was docked at `r cal.loc` (`r cal.lat.dd` $^{\circ}\textrm{N}$, `r cal.lon.dd` $^{\circ}\textrm{W}$) using the standard sphere technique [@Foote1987; @Demer2015]. Each WBT was calibrated in both CW (i.e., continuous wave or chirp mode) and FM modes (i.e., frequency modulation or broadband mode). The reference target was a `r cal.sphere` (`r cal.sphere.name`); calibrations of WBTs in FM mode used both the WC38.1 and a smaller 25 mm WC sphere (not presented). A CTD was cast to measure temperature and salinity versus depth, to estimate sound speeds at the transducer and sphere depths, and the time-averaged sound speed and absorption coefficients for the range between them. The theoretical target strength ($TS$; dB re 1 m^2^) of the sphere was calculated using the Standard Sphere Target Strength Calculator^[http://swfscdata.nmfs.noaa.gov/AST/SphereTS/] and values for the sphere, sound-pulse, and seawater properties. The sphere was positioned throughout the main lobe of each of the transducer beams using three motorized downriggers, two on one side of the vessel and one on the other. The GPTs and WBTs were configured using the calibration results via the control software (EK80 `r ek80.version`, Simrad; **Table \@ref(tab:cal-results)**). Calibration results for WBTs in FM mode are not presented.

#### Data collection {#methods-acoustic-data-collection}  

Computer clocks were synchronized with the GPS clock (GMT) using synchronization software (NetTime^[http://timesynctool.com]). Echosounder pulses were transmitted simultaneously at all frequencies, at variable intervals, as controlled by the ER60 Adaptive Logger [EAL^[https://swfsc.noaa.gov/eal/], @Renfree2016]. The EAL optimizes the pulse interval, based on the seabed depth, while avoiding aliased seabed echoes. The echosounders collected data continuously throughout the survey, but transect sampling was conducted only during daylight hours, approximately between sunrise and sunset.  

Measurements of volume backscattering strength ($S_V$; dB re 1 m^2^ m^-3^) and $TS$ (dB re 1 m^2^), indexed by time and geographic positions provided by GPS receivers, were logged to 60 m beyond the detected seabed range or to a maximum of `r raw.log.range` m, and stored in Simrad format (i.e., .raw) with a `r raw.size`-MB maximum file size. For each acoustic instrument, the prefix for the file names is a concatenation of the survey name (e.g.,  `r survey.name`), the operational mode (CW or FM), and the logging commencement date and time from the EK80 software. For example, file generated by the Simrad EK80 software (`r ek80.version`) for a WBT operated in CW mode is named `1907RL-CW-D20190723-T125901.raw`.  

To minimize acoustic interference, transmit pulses from the ME70, the MS70, the SX90, and the acoustic Doppler current profiler (Ocean Surveyor Model OS75 ADCP, Teledyne RD Instruments) were triggered using the K-Sync synchronization system (Simrad). All other instruments that produce sound within the echosounder bandwidths were secured during daytime survey operations. Exceptions were made during stations (e.g., plankton sampling and fish trawling) or in shallow water when the vessel's command occasionally operated the bridge's 50- and 200-kHz echosounders (Furuno), the Doppler velocity log (Sperry Marine Model SRD-500A), or both.  

### Oceanographic sampling {#methods-oceanographic-sampling}
#### Conductivity and temperature versus depth (CTD) sampling {#methods-ctd-sampling}  

Day and night, conductivity and temperature were measured versus depth to `r ctd.depth` m (or to within ~10 m of the seabed when less than `r ctd.depth` m) with calibrated sensors on a CTD rosette (Model SBE911+, Seabird) or underway probe (UnderwayCTD, Oceanscience) cast from the vessel. These data were used to calculate the harmonic mean sound speed [@Demer2015] for estimating ranges to the sound scatterers, and frequency-specific sound absorption coefficients for compensating signal attenuation of the sound pulse between the transducer and scatters [@Simmonds2005] (see **Section \@ref(methods-sound-calcs)**). These data also indicated the depth of the surface mixed layer, above which most epipelagic CPS reside during the day, which is later used to determine the integration-stop depth and remove non-CPS backscatter during acoustic data processing (see **Section \@ref(methods-backscatter-removal)**).  

#### Scientific Computer System sampling {#methods-scs-sampling}  

While underway, information about the position and direction (e.g., latitude, longitude, speed, course over ground, and heading), weather (air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and barometric pressure), and sea-surface oceanography (e.g., temperature, salinity, and fluorescence) were measured continuously and logged using _`r survey.vessel`_'s Scientific Computer System (SCS). During and after the survey, data from a subset of these sensors, logged with a standardized form at 1-min resolution, are available on the internet via NOAA's ERDDAP data server^[https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html].  

###  Fish egg sampling {#methods-cufes-sampling}  

During the day, fish eggs were sampled using continuous underway fish egg sampler [CUFES, @Checkley1997], which collects water and plankton at a rate of ~640 l min^-1^ from an intake at ~3-m depth on the hull of the ship. The particles in the sampled water were sieved by a 505-$\mu$m mesh. Pacific Sardine, Northern Anchovy, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Hake (_Merluccius productus_) eggs were identified to species, counted, and logged. Eggs from other species (e.g., Pacific Mackerel and flatfishes) were also counted and logged as "other fish eggs." Typically, the duration of each CUFES sample was 30 min, corresponding to a distance of 5 nmi at a speed of 10 kn. Because the duration of the initial stages of the egg phase is short for most fish species, the egg distributions inferred from CUFES indicated the nearby presence of actively spawning fish, and were used in combination with CPS echoes to select trawl locations.  

### Trawl sampling {#methods-trawl-sampling}  

After sunset, CPS schools tend to ascend and disperse and are less likely to avoid a net [@Mais1977]. Therefore, trawling was conducted during the night to better sample the fish aggregations dispersed near the surface to obtain information about species composition, lengths, and weights.  

\newpage  

#### Sampling gear {#methods-trawl-gear}  

The net, a Nordic 264 rope trawl (NET Systems, Bainbridge Island, WA; **Fig. \@ref(fig:trawl-diagrams)a,b**), was towed at the surface for 45 min at a speed of 3.5-4.5 kn. The net has a rectangular opening with an area of approximately 300 m^2^ (~15-m tall x 20-m wide), a throat with variable-sized mesh and a "marine mammal excluder device" to prevent the capture of large animals, such as dolphins, turtles, or sharks while retaining target species [@Dotson2010], and an 8-mm square-mesh cod-end liner (to retain a large range of animal sizes). The trawl doors were foam-filled and the trawl headrope was lined with floats so the trawl towed at the surface.

\newpage  

#### Sampling locations {#methods-trawl-locations}  

Up to three nighttime (i.e., 30 min after sunset to 30 min before sunrise) surface trawls, typically spaced 10-nmi apart, were conducted in areas where echoes from putative CPS schools were observed earlier that day (**Fig. \@ref(fig:trawling-locs)**). Each evening, trawl locations were selected by an acoustician who monitored CPS echoes and a member of the trawl group who measured the densities of CPS eggs in the CUFES. The locations were provided to the watch Officers who charted the proposed trawl sites.  

Trawl locations were selected using the following criteria, in descending priority: CPS schools in echograms that day; CPS eggs in CUFES that day; and the trawl locations and catches during the previous night. If no CPS echoes or CPS eggs were observed along a transect that day, the trawls were alternatively placed nearshore one night and offshore the next night, with consideration given to the seabed depth and the modeled distribution of CPS habitat. Each morning, after the last trawl or 30 min prior to sunrise, _`r survey.vessel`_ resumed sampling at the location where the acoustic sampling stopped the previous day.  

(ref:trawling-locs) Example of trawl paths (bold, black lines) relative to 38-kHz integrated backscattering coefficients from putative CPS schools averaged over 2000-m distance intervals and from 5 to 70 m deep ($s_A$, m^2^ nmi^-2^; colored points).

#### Sample processing {#methods-trawl-processing}  

If the total volume of the trawl catch was five 35-l baskets (~175 l) or less, all target species were separated from the catch, sorted by species, weighed, and enumerated. If the volume of the entire catch was more than five baskets, a five-basket random subsample that included non-target species was collected, sorted by species, weighed, and enumerated; the remainder of the total catch was weighed. In these cases, the weight of the entire catch was calculated as the sum of the subsample and remainder weights. The weight of the $e$-th species in the total catch ($C_{T,e}$) was obtained by summing the catch weight of the respective species in the subsample ($C_{S,e}$) and the corresponding catch in the remainder ($C_{R,e}$), which was calculated as:  

\begin{equation}
 C_{R,e} = C_R*P_{w,e}\text{,}
 (\#eq:remainder-catch-weight)
\end{equation}

where $P_{w,e} = C_{S,e}/\sum_1^sC_{S,e}$, is the proportion in weight of the $e$-th species in the subsample. The number of specimens of the $e$-th species in the total catch ($N_{T,e}$) was estimated by:  

\begin{equation}
 N_{T,e} = \frac{C_{T,e}}{\overline{w}_e}\text{,}
 (\#eq:number-specimens-catch)
\end{equation}

where $\overline{w}_e$ is the mean weight of the $e$-th species in the subsample. For each of the target species with 50 specimens or less, individual measurements of length in mm (standard length, $L_S$, for Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy, and fork length, $L_F$, for Pacific Herring and Jack and Pacific Mackerels) and total weight ($w$) in g were recorded. In addition, sex and maturity were recorded for up to 50 specimens from all species. Ovaries were preserved for up to 10 specimens of each CPS species except Pacific Herring. Fin clips were removed from 50 Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy specimens from five different geographic zones (designated by J. Hyde and M. Craig, SWFSC) and preserved in ethanol for genetic analysis. Otoliths were removed from all 50 Pacific Sardine in the subsample; for other CPS species, 25 otoliths were removed "as equally as possible" from the range of sizes present. Regional species composition was estimated from the nearest trawl cluster, i.e., the combined catches of up to three trawls per night, separated by less than 12 h.  

\newpage  

#### QA/QC {#methods-trawl-qaqc}  

At sea, trawl data were entered into a database (Microsoft Access). During and following the survey, data were further scrutinized, verified, and corrected if found to be erroneous. Missing length ($L_{miss}$) and weight ($W_{miss}$) measurements were estimated using the season-specific length-versus-weight relationships derived from catches during previous ATM surveys (unpublished data), where $W_{miss} = \beta_0{L}^{\beta_1}$, $L_{miss} = (W/\beta_0)^{(1/\beta_1)}$, and values for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ in **Table \@ref(tab:lw-conversions)**. To identify measurement or data-entry errors, length and weight data were graphically compared (**Fig. \@ref(fig:lw-plot)**) to measurements from previous surveys and models of season-specific length-versus-weight from previous surveys (unpublished data). Outliers and missing values were flagged, reviewed by the trawl team, and mitigated. Catch data from aborted or otherwise unacceptable trawl hauls were removed.

## Data processing {#methods-data-processing}  
### Acoustic and oceanographic data {#methods-acoustic-processing}  

The calibrated echosounder data from each transect were processed using commercial software ([Echoview](https://www.echoview.com/) `r ev.version`, Echoview Software Pty Ltd.) and estimates of the sound speed and absorption coefficient calculated with contemporaneous data from CTD probes cast while stationary or underway (UCTD, see **Section \@ref(methods-ctd-sampling)**). Data collected along the daytime transects at speeds $\geq$ 5 kn were used to estimate CPS densities. Nighttime acoustic data were assumed to be negatively biased due to diel-vertical migration (DVM) and disaggregation of the target species’ schools [@Cutter2008]. 

### Sound speed and absorption calculation {#methods-sound-calcs}  

Depth derived from pressure in CTD casts was used to bin samples into 1-m depth increments. Sound speed in each increment ($c_{w,i}$, m s^-1^) was estimated from the average salinity, density, and pH [if measured, else pH = 8; @Chen1977;@Seabird2013]. The harmonic sound speed in the water column ($\overline{c}_w$, m s^-1^) was calculated over the upper 70 m as:  

\begin{equation}
 \overline{c}_w = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \Delta r_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \Delta r_i/c_{w,i}}\text{,}
 (\#eq:time-avg-sound-speed)
\end{equation}

where $\Delta r$ is the depth of increment $i$ [@Seabird2013]. Measurements of seawater temperature ($t_w$, $^{\circ}\textrm{C}$), salinity ($s_w$, psu), depth, pH, and $\overline{c}_w$ are also used to calculate the mean species-specific absorption coefficients ($\overline{\alpha}_a$, dB m^-1^) over the entire profile using equations in Francois and Garrison [-@Francois1982a], Ainslie and McColm [-@Ainslie1998], and Doonan et al. [-@Doonan2003]. Both $\overline{c}_w$ and $\overline{\alpha}_a$ are later used to estimate ranges to the sound scatterers to compensate the echo signal for spherical spreading and attenuation during propagation of the sound pulse from the transducer to the scatterer range and back [@Simmonds2005]. The CTD rosette, when cast, also provides measures of fluorescence and dissolved oxygen concentration versus depth, which may be used to estimate the vertical dimension of Pacific Sardine potential habitat [@Zwolinski2011], particularly the depth of the upper-mixed layer where most epipelagic CPS reside. The latter information is used to inform echo classification (see **Section \@ref(methods-echo-classification)**).  

### Echo-classification {#methods-echo-classification}  

Echoes from schooling CPS were identified using a semi-automated data processing algorithm implemented using Echoview software (`r ev.version`). The filters and thresholds were based on a subsample of echoes from randomly selected CPS schools. The aim of the filter criteria is to retain at least 95% of the noise-free backscatter from CPS schools while rejecting at least 95% of the non-CPS backscatter (**Fig. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)**). The filter includes the following steps:

+ Estimate and subtract background noise using the background noise removal function [@DeRobertis2007,  **Fig. \@ref(fig:ev-filtering-example)b,e**] in Echoview;
+ Average the noise-free $S_v$ echograms using non-overlapping 11-sample by 3-ping bins;
+ Expand the averaged, noise-reduced _S~v~_ echograms with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation;
+ For each pixel, compute: $S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$, $S_{v,\mathrm{120kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$, and $S_{v,\mathrm{70kHz}}-S_{v,\mathrm{38kHz}}$;

+ Compute the standard deviations (SDs) of $S_{v,\mathrm{120kHz}}$ and $S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}$ using non-overlapping 11-sample by 3-ping bins;

+ Create a Boolean echogram based on the SDs in the CPS range: SD($S_{v,\mathrm{200kHz}}$) > -65 dB and SD($S_{v,\mathrm{120kHz}}$) > -65 dB. Diffuse backscattering layers [@Zwolinski2010] have low standard deviations whereas fish schools have high standard deviations [@Demer2009];
+ Intersect the two Boolean echograms to create an echogram with "TRUE" samples for candidate CPS schools and "FALSE" elsewhere;

+ Set the minimum $S_v$ threshold to -60 dB (corresponding to a density of approximately three 20-cm-long Pacific Sardine per 100 m^3^);
+ Integrate the volume backscattering coefficients ($s_V$, m^2^ m^-3^) attributed to CPS over 5-m depths and averaged over 100-m distances;
+ Output the resulting nautical area scattering coefficients ($s_A$; m^2^ nmi^-2^) and associated information from each transect and frequency to comma-delimited text (.csv) files.  

When necessary, the start and stop integration lines were manually edited to exclude reverberation due to bubbles, to include the entirety of shallow CPS aggregations, or to exclude seabed echoes.  

### Removal of non-CPS backscatter {#methods-backscatter-removal}  

In addition to echoes from target CPS, echoes may also be present from other CPS (Pacific Saury, _Cololabis saira_), or semi-demersal fish such as Pacific Hake and rockfishes ($Sebastes$ spp.). When analyzing the acoustic-survey data, it was therefore necessary to filter "acoustic by-catch," i.e., backscatter not from the target species. To exclude echoes from mid-water, demersal, and benthic fishes, vertical temperature profiles were superimposed on the echo-integrated data for each transect. Echoes below the surface mixed layer were excluded from the CPS analysis (**Fig. \@ref(fig:ctd-app)**). In areas dominated by Pacific Herring, for example off Vancouver Island, backscatter was integrated to a maximum depth of 75 m.

The proximity of the echoes to the seabed (bold, red line; right panel) was also used to define the lower limit for vertical integration.

### QA/QC {#methods-acoustics-qaqc}  

The largest 38-kHz integrated backscattering coefficient values ($s_A$, m^2^ nmi^-2^) were graphically examined to identify potential errors in the integrated data from Echoview processing (e.g.,  when a portion of the seabed was accidentally integrated). If found, errors were corrected and data were re-integrated prior to use for biomass estimation.

The $s_A$ values for the 100-m intervals are divided by 19 for scaling to the traditional horizontal bin length, or Elementary Distance Sampling Unit (EDSU), of 1 nmi.

### Echo integral partitioning and acoustic inversion {#methods-echointegration}  

For fishes with swimbladders, the acoustic backscattering cross-section of an individual ($\sigma_{bs}$, m^2^) depends on many factors but mostly on the acoustic wavelength and the swimbladder size and orientation relative to the incident sound pulse. For echosounder sampling conducted in this survey, $\sigma_{bs}$ is a function of the dorsal-surface area of the swimbladder and was approximated by a function of fish length, i.e.:

\begin{equation}
  \sigma_{bs} = 10^{\frac{m\,\log_{10}(L)+b}{10}}\text{,}
  (\#eq:sigma-bs)
\end{equation}

where $m$ and $b$ are frequency and species-specific parameters that are obtained theoretically or experimentally (see references below). $TS$, a logarithmic representation of $\sigma_{bs}$, is defined as:

\begin{equation}
  TS = 10\,\log_{10}(\sigma_{bs}) = m\,\log_{10}(L) + b\text{.}
  (\#eq:ts-sigma-bs-equation)
\end{equation}

$TS$ has units of dB re 1 m^2^ if defined for an individual, or dB re 1 m^2^ kg^-1^ if defined by weight. The following equations for $TS_{38\mathrm{kHz}}$ were used in this analysis:  

\begin{equation}
  TS_{\mathrm{38kHz}} = -14.90 \times (\log_{10} (L_T) - 13.21 \text{, for Pacific Sardine;}
  (\#eq:tl-ts-sardine)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  TS_{\mathrm{38kHz}} = -11.97 \times (\log_{10} (L_T) - 11.58561 \text{, for Pacific Herring;}
  (\#eq:tl-ts-herring)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  TS_{\mathrm{38kHz}} = -13.87 \times (\log_{10} (L_T) - 11.797 \text{, for Northern Anchovy; and}
  (\#eq:tl-ts-anchovy)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  TS_{\mathrm{38kHz}} = -15.44 \times (\log_{10} (L_T) - 7.75 \text{, for Pacific and Jack Mackerels,}
  (\#eq:tl-ts-mackerel)
\end{equation}

where the units for total length ($L_T$) is cm and $TS$ is dB re 1 m^2^ kg^-1^.  

Equations \@ref(eq:tl-ts-sardine) and \@ref(eq:tl-ts-mackerel) were derived from echosounder measurements of in situ $\sigma_{bs}$ and measures of $L_T$ and $W$ from concomitant catches of South American Pilchard (_Sardinops ocellatus_) and Horse Mackerel (_Trachurus trachurus_) off South Africa [@Barange1996]. Because mackerels have similar $TS$ [@Pena2008], Equation \@ref(eq:tl-ts-mackerel) is used for Pacific and Jack Mackerels. For Pacific Herring, Equation \@ref(eq:tl-ts-herring) was derived from that of Thomas et al. [-@Thomas2002] measured at 120 kHz with the following modifications: 1) the intercept used here was calculated as the average intercept of Thomas et al.'s spring and fall regressions; 2) the intercept was compensated for swimbladder compression after Zhao et al. [-@Zhao2008] using the average depth for Pacific Herring of 44 m; 3) the intercept was increased by 2.98 dB to account for the change of frequency from 120 to 38 kHz [@Saunders2012]. For Northern Anchovy, Equation \@ref(eq:tl-ts-anchovy) was derived from that of Kang et al. [-@Kang2009], after compensation of the swimbladder volume [@Ona2003;@Zhao2008] for the average depth of Northern Anchovy observed in summer 2016 [19 m, @Zwolinski2017].  

To calculate $TS_{38\mathrm{kHz}}$, $L_T$ (cm) was estimated from measurements of standard length ($L_S$) or fork length ($L_F$; cm) using linear relationships between length and weight derived from specimens collected in the CCE: for Pacific Sardine, $L_T = 0.3574 + 1.149L_S$; for Northern Anchovy, $L_T = 0.2056 + 1.1646 L_S$; for Pacific Mackerel, $L_T = 0.2994 + 1.092 L_F$; for Jack Mackerel $L_T = 0.7295 + 1.078 L_F$; and for Pacific Herring $L_T = -0.105 + 1.2 L_F$.  

(ref:ll-conversions) Slopes (_m_) and intercepts (_b_) from linear models used to convert standard length ($L_S$) and fork length ($L_F$) measurements to total length ($L_T$) using the equations: $L_T = \beta_1{L_S} + \beta_{0_{L_S}}$ and $L_T = \beta_1{L_F} + \beta_{0_{L_F}}$.

The proportions of species in a trawl cluster were considered representative of the proportions of species in the vicinity of the cluster. Therefore, the proportion of the echo-integral from the $e$-th species ($P_e$) in an ensemble of $s$ species can be calculated from the species catches $N_1, N_2,..., N_s$ and the respective average backscattering cross-sections $\sigma_{bs_1}, \sigma_{bs_2},...,\sigma_{bs_s}$ [@Nakken1975]. The acoustic proportion for the $e$-th species in the $a$-th trawl ($P_{ae}$) is:

\begin{equation}
 P_{ae} = \frac{N_{ae} \times \overline{w}_{ae} \times \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae}}{\sum_{e=1}^{s_a} (N_{ae} \times \overline{w}_{ae} \times \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae})}\text{, }
  (\#eq:acoustic-prop-spp)
\end{equation}

where $\overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae}$ is the arithmetic counterpart of the average target strength ($\overline{TS}_{ae}$) averaged for all $n_{ae}$ individuals of species $e$ in the random sample of trawl $a$:  

\begin{equation}
  \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n_{ae}}10^{(TS_i/10)}}{n_{ae}}\text{, }
  (\#eq:avg-ts-all-spp)
\end{equation}

and $\overline{w}_{ae}$ is the average weight: $\overline{w}_{ae} = \sum_{i=1}^{n_{ae}}{w_{aei}}/{n_{ae}}$. The total number of individuals of species $e$ in a trawl $a$ ($N_{ae}$) is obtained by: $N_{ae}=\frac{n_{ae}}{w_{s,ae}} \times w_{t,ae}$, where $w_{s,ae}$ is the weight of the $n_{ae}$ individuals sampled randomly, and $w_{t,ae}$ is the total weight of the respective species' catch.  

The trawls within a cluster were combined to reduce sampling variability (see **Section \@ref(methods-trawl-clustering)**), and the number of individuals caught from the $e$-th species in a cluster $g$ ($N_{ge}$) was obtained by summing the catches across the $h$ trawls in the cluster: $N_{ge}=\sum_{a=1}^{h_g}N_{ae}$.  The backscattering cross-section for species $e$ in the $g$-th cluster with $a$ trawls is then given by:  

\begin{equation}
  \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ge}=\frac{\sum_{a=1}^{h_g} N_{ae} \times \overline{w}_{ae} \times \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae}}{\sum_{a=1}^{s_g} N_{ae} \times \overline{w}_{ae}}\text{, }
  (\#eq:sigma-spp-j)
\end{equation}

where:  

\begin{equation}
  \overline{w}_{ge} = \frac{\sum_{a=1}^{h_g} N_{ae} \times \overline{w}_{ae}}{\sum_{a=1}^{h_g} N_{ae}}\text{, }
  (\#eq:w-spp-j)
\end{equation}

and the proportion ($P_{ge}$) is;

\begin{equation}
  P_{ge} = \frac{N_{ge} \times \overline{w}_{ge} \times \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ae}}{\sum_{e=1}^{s}(N_{ge} \times \overline{w}_{ge} \times \overline{\sigma}_{bs,ge})}\text{.}
  (\#eq:prop-spp-j)
\end{equation}  

### Trawl clustering and species proportions {#methods-trawl-clustering}  

Trawls that occurred on the same night were assigned to a trawl cluster. Biomass densities ($\rho$) were calculated for 100-m transect intervals by dividing the integrated area backscatter coefficients for each CPS species by the mean backscattering cross-sectional area [@MacLennan2002] estimated in the trawl cluster nearest in space. Survey data were post-stratified to account for spatial heterogeneity in sampling effort and biomass density in a similar way to that performed for Pacific Sardine [@Zwolinski2016].  

For a generic 100-m long acoustic interval, the area backscattering coefficient for species $e$: $s_{A,e} = s_{A,cps} \times P_{ge}$, where $P_{ge}$ is the species acoustic proportion of the nearest trawl cluster (Equation \@ref(eq:prop-spp-j)), was used to estimate the biomass density ($\rho_{w,e}$) [@MacLennan2002; @Simmonds2005] for every 100-m interval, using the size and species composition of the nearest (space and time) trawl cluster (**Fig. \@ref(fig:trawl-cluster-map)**):

\begin{equation}
  \rho_{w,e} = \frac{s_{A,e}}{4\pi\overline{\sigma}_{bs,e}}\text{.}
  (\#eq:biomass-density)
\end{equation}  

The biomass densities were converted to numerical densities using: $\rho_{n,e}=\rho_{w,e}/\overline{w}_e$, where $\overline{w}_e$ is the corresponding mean weight. Also, for each acoustic interval, the biomass or numeric densities are partitioned into length classes according to the species' length distribution in the respective trawl cluster.  

<!-- ### Removal of coincident sampling -->
<!-- To avoid overestimation of biomass in areas sampled by both vessels, USV samples were omitted within the area sampled by _`r survey.vessel`_.   -->

## Data analysis {#methods-data-analysis}
### Post-stratification {#methods-post-stratification}  

The transects were used as sampling units [@Simmonds1996]. Because each species does not generally span the entire survey area [@Zwolinski2014;@Demer2017], the sampling domain was stratified for each species and stock. Strata were defined by uniform transect spacing (sampling intensity) and either presences (positive densities and potentially structural zeros) or absences (real zeros) of species biomass. Each stratum has: 1) at least three transects, with approximately equal spacing, 2) fewer than three consecutive transects with zero-biomass density, and 3) bounding transects with zero-biomass density (**Figs. \@ref(fig:tx-biom-dens)**, **\@ref(fig:acoustic-strata-map)**). This approach tracks stock patchiness and creates statistically-independent, stationary, post-sampling strata [@Johannesson1983; @Simmonds1992]. For Northern Anchovy, we define the separation between the northern and central stock at Cape Mendocino (`r round(stock.break.anch,1)` $^{\circ}\textrm{N}$). For Pacific Sardine, we define the separation between the northern and southern stock by the boundary between their respective potential oceanographic habitats [@Zwolinski2011; @Demer2014], in this case at Point Conception (`r round(stock.break.sar,1)` $^{\circ}\textrm{N}$).

### Estimation of biomass and sampling precision {#methods-biomass-and-precision}  

For each stratum and stock, the biomass ($B$; kg) of each species was estimated by: 

\begin{equation}
  \hat{B} = A \times \hat{D}\text{, }
  (\#eq:biomass-mean)
\end{equation}

where $A$ is the stratum area (nmi^2^) and $\hat{D}$ is the estimated mean biomass density (kg nmi^-2^):

\begin{equation}
  \hat{D} = \frac{\sum_{l=1}^{k}\overline{\rho}_{w,l} c_l}{\sum_{l=1}^{k}c_l}\text{, }
  (\#eq:biomass-mean-density)
\end{equation}

where $\overline{\rho}_{w,l}$ is the mean biomass density of the species on transect $l$, $c_l$ is the transect length, and $k$ is the total number of transects. The variance of $\hat{B}$ is a function of the variability of the transect-mean densities and associated lengths. Treating transects as replicate samples of the underlying population [@Simmonds1996], the variance was calculated using bootstrap resampling [@Efron1981] based on transects as sampling units. Provided that each stratum has independent and identically-distributed transect means (i.e., densities on nearby transects are not correlated, and they share the same statistical distribution), bootstrap or other random-sampling estimators provide unbiased estimates of variance.

The 95% confidence intervals (CI~95%~) for the mean biomass densities ($\hat{D}$) were estimated as the 0.025 and 0.975 percentiles of the distribution of `r boot.num` bootstrap survey-mean biomass densities. Coefficient of variation (CV, %) values were obtained by dividing the bootstrapped standard error by the mean estimate [@Efron1981]. Total biomass in the survey area was estimated as the sum of the biomasses in each stratum, and the associated sampling variance was calculated as the sum of the variances across strata.  

### Abundance- and biomass-at-length estimates {#methods-abundance-at-length}  

The numerical densities by length class (**Section \@ref(methods-trawl-clustering)**) were averaged for each stratum in a similar way for that used for biomass (Equation \@ref(eq:biomass-mean-density)), and raised to the stratum area to obtain abundance per length class.  

### Percent contribution of biomass per cluster {#methods-cluster-biomass-density}  

The percent contribution of each cluster to the estimated abundance in a stratum (**Appendix \@ref(appendix-cluster-length-percent)**) was calculated as:  

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^{l}\overline{\rho}_{ci}}{\Sigma_{c=1}^{C}\Sigma_{i=1}^{l}\overline{\rho}_{ci}}{\text{,}}
  (\#eq:pct-acoustic-biomass)
\end{equation}

where $\overline{\rho}_{ci}$ is the numerical density in interval $i$ represented by the nearest trawl cluster $c$.

Catches from a total of `r nrow(haul)` nighttime surface trawls were combined into `r n_distinct(haul$cluster)` trawl clusters. As many as `r num2words(max(as.numeric(be$Stratum),na.rm = T))` post-survey strata were defined considering transect spacing and the densities of echoes attributed to CPS. Biomasses and abundances were estimated for each species.  

**Leg I**  
On 13 June, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from the Exploratorium (Pier 15) in San Francisco, CA at ~1800 (all times UTC) and began the transit to northern Vancouver Island. Throughout the transit, sampling was conducted during the day with CUFES, EK60s, EK80s, ME70, MS70 and SX90. On 17 June, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the first offshore station off Cape Scott, British Columbia at ~1230 to begin acoustic sampling along transect 129. On 1 July, acoustic sampling ceased after the completion of transect 84 off Newport, OR. On 2 July, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the Marine Operations-Pacific (MOC-P) Pier in Newport at ~2100 to complete Leg I.  

On 21 June, Greg Shaughnessy (Ocean Gold Seafoods) embarked _`r survey.vessel`_ from F/V _Lisa Marie_ to observe survey operations. At the same time, Josiah Renfree boarded _Lisa Marie_ to remedy minor issues with the echosounder before rejoining _`r survey.vessel`_. At ~1900 on 25 June, Mr. Shaughnessy disembarked and was put ashore in Westport, WA via _`r survey.vessel`_'s skiff.  

**Leg II**  
On 8 July, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from MOC-P Pier in Newport, OR, at ~0000. Acoustic sampling resumed at ~0145 on 8 July along transect 083 south of Newport, OR. On 24 July, acoustic sampling ceased after the completion of transect 050 off Albion, CA. On 25 July, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the Pier 30/32 in San Francisco, CA at ~1300 to complete Leg II.  

**Leg III**  

On 30 July, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from Pier 30/32 in San Francisco at ~1300 and transited to transect 049 north of the Point Arena lighthouse. Trawling was conducted during the evening of 30 July, prior to resuming acoustic sampling along transect 049 on 31 July. Intermittent malfunctions of the trawl winch encoders reduced trawl sampling from 1-2 August. Increased malfunctions of the trawl-winch encoders prohibited trawling between 3 and 6 August. On 6 August, the trawl winches were repaired and normal sampling resumed. On 16 August, acoustic sampling ceased after the completion of transect 023 off Morro Bay. On 17 August, _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego, CA at ~1400 to complete Leg III.  

**Leg IV**

On 22 August, _`r survey.vessel`_ departed from 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego at ~1500. Training on the ship’s dynamic-positioning system was performed in San Diego Harbor until ~2000, after which _`r survey.vessel`_ transited to transect 019 off Pismo Beach. On 23 August, at ~1700, _`r survey.vessel`_ deployed a benthic acoustic lander off Pt. Conception, then resumed acoustic sampling along transect 019 at ~1800. On 1 September, _`r survey.vessel`_'s fog horn was repaired using parts received from ashore via skiff. At ~1500 on 1 September, the UCTD probe was lost when a small vessel running parallel to the ship made a sharp turn across the stern and severed the line. At ~0200 on 7 September, acoustic sampling ceased after the completion of transect 001 off San Diego. _`r survey.vessel`_ arrived at the 10th Avenue Marine Terminal in San Diego at ~2100 on 8 September to complete the survey.

Acoustic backscatter ascribed to CPS (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)a**) was observed throughout the survey area, but was most prevalent off southwest Vancouver Island and Cape Flattery; nearshore between the Columbia River and Cape Mendocino; and througout the entire survey area between Cape Blanco and San Diego. The majority (greater than ~90%) of biomass for each species was apportioned using catch data from trawl clusters conducted within a distance of $\leq$ 20 nmi (**Fig. \@ref(fig:biomass-cluster-distance)**).  

## Egg densities and distributions {#results-cufes-density}  

Northern Anchovy eggs were abundant in CUFES samples nearshore off the Columbia River; offshore north of Newport; and offshore between approximately San Francisco and Morro Bay (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)b**). Pacific Sardine eggs were abundant nearshore between the Columbia River and Cape Blanco; and offshore between Cape Blanco and Cape Mendocino (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)b**). Jack Mackerel eggs were observed between approximately Newport and Cape Mendocino, offshore between approximately San Francisco and Morro Bay, and in the southern portion of the SCB (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)b**). Between Newport and Cape Mendocino, Jack Mackerel eggs were coincident with Pacific Sardine Eggs (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)b**).  

## Trawl catch {#results-trawl-catch}  

Pacific Herring catches were predominant, by weight, in trawl samples collected off Vancouver Island and nearshore off WA, north of the Columbia River (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**). Jack Mackerel dominated the trawl catches between approximately Newport and Bodega Bay (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**). Northern Anchovy was the predominant species in trawl catches from inshore and offshore between Bodega Bay and San Diego. Pacific Sardine were caught in relatively small numbers between the Columbia River and Cape Mendocino, near Bodega Bay, and around the northern Channel Islands in the SCB (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**). A few Pacific Mackerel were caught along the OR and northern CA coasts, and offshore near Bodega Bay and Pt. Conception (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nasc-cufes-trawl)c**). Overall, the `r nrow(haul)` trawls captured a combined `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$AllCPS),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of CPS (`r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'Anchovy'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Northern Anchovy, `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'Sardine'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Sardine, `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'PacMack'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Pacific Mackerel, `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'JackMack'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg of Jack Mackerel, and `r prettyNum(sum(cluster.summ.wt$'PacHerring'),big.mark=",",digits=3)` kg Pacific Herring).

The Jack Mackerel ranged from approximately Westport to Bodega Bay, and from Morro Bay to San Diego, but biomass was greatest between Cape Blanco and Bodega Bay (**Fig. \@ref(fig:biom-dens-jack)a**). $L_F$ ranged from `r length.summ$L.min[length.summ$scientificName == 'Trachurus symmetricus']` to `r length.summ$L.max[length.summ$scientificName == 'Trachurus symmetricus']` cm, with modes at 7, 21-22, and 28-32 cm (**Table \@ref(tab:l-freq-summ-jack)**, **Fig. \@ref(fig:l-disagg-jack)**).  

The estimated biomass of Jack Mackerel in the nearshore region was `r prettyNum(be.all.ns$Biomass[be.all.ns$Species == 'Trachurus symmetricus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.ns$lower.ci.B[be.all.ns$Species == 'Trachurus symmetricus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.ns$upper.ci.B[be.all.ns$Species == 'Trachurus symmetricus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t, CV = `r prettyNum(be.all.ns$biomass.cv[be.all.ns$Species == 'Trachurus symmetricus'],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%; **Table \@ref(tab:biomass-jack)**, **Fig. \@ref(fig:biom-dens-jack)b**). The stock was distributed between Westport and Fort Bragg, and to a lesser extent in the SCB between Santa Barbara and San Diego.

# (ref:biomass-ts-sardine) Time series of biomass and density-weighted lengths for the northern stock of sardine indicates that the population was dominated by the 2003-2005 cohort between 2006 and 2010; and the 2009-2010 cohort from 2011 through 2015. In 2017 it is likely that the bulk of the sardine between 18 and 22 cm are we conjecture that Consistent estimates result from spring and summer surveys in the same years (2008, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015).

## Biomass time series {#results-biomass-time-series}  
# The 2017 summer ATM estimates of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine biomass and demography are coherent, although the summer survey also indicated recruitment of sardine born in early 2015 (**Fig. \@ref(fig:biomass-ts-sardine)**). While sardine potential habitat has continued to extend to north Vancouver Island during summers, the stock has not migrated there since 2013 [@Zwolinski2014] and the migration of the declining stock has progressively contracted.

# Discussion {#discussion} 
The principal objectives of the `r survey.das`-day, Summer 2019 CCE Survey were to survey the northern stock of Pacific Sardine and the northern and central stock of Northern Anchovy. Then, as possible, estimates were also sought for Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, Pacific Herring, and the southern stock of Pacific Sardine. With the benefit of favorable weather and few technical problems, _`r survey.vessel`_ surveyed from the northern end of Vancouver Island to San Diego. South of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, all transects were spaced `r adaptive.spacing`-nmi apart, which allowed the precise estimation of abundance for all five species of small pelagic fishes in the survey region.  

## Additional topics
* Biomass estimates were derived using the best available data in each area. A such:
    + No purse seine data from LBC was included due to:
        + Purse seine sampling outside nearshore area sampled by acoustics
        + Numerous log books mentions of anchovies, but few/none represented in catch
    + _Lisa Marie_ data used instead of Saildrone off WA/OR:
        + More contemporaneous acoustic sampling with _Lasker_ sampling
        + Purse seine catches more reflective of samples from _Lasker_'s trawls
        + No/fewer biological sampling for apportioning Saildrone backscatter
* A small amount of backscatter in the offshore area was expanded over a large offshore area, resulting in a relatively large (40%) additional of backscatter in that region, with few offshore trawls used to characterize species and size composition
    + Applied a distance filter to constrain the acoustic intervals that were reasonably thought to be represented by trawl clusters?

## Biomass and abundance of CPS
### Northern Anchovy {#discussion-anchovy-biomass} 
#### Northern stock {#discussion-anchovy-biomass-northern}  

The northern stock of Northern Anchovy is north of Cape Mendocino and south of Haida Gwaii, BC [~54 $^\circ$N; @Litz2008]. In summer 2019, the estimated stock biomass, `r prettyNum(sum(be.anch.n$Biomass), big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be$lower.ci.B[be$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be$Stock == "Northern" & be$Stratum == "All"],big.mark=",",digits=5)` - `r prettyNum(be$upper.ci.B[be$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be$Stock == "Northern" & be$Stratum == "All"],big.mark=",",digits=5)` t) was considerably lower than the estimate of 22,709 t (CI~95%~ = 1,452 - 57,334 t) [@Zwolinski2019a] in summer 2017 and 24,419 t (CI~95%~ = 5,366 - 42,068 t) in summer 2018 [@Stierhoff2019b]. **[Discuss why.]**  

#### Central stock {#discussion-anchovy-biomass-central}  

The estimated biomass of the central stock of Northern Anchovy was `r prettyNum(sum(be.anch.c$Biomass), big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be$lower.ci.B[be$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be$Stock == "Central" & be$Stratum == "All"],big.mark=",",digits=5)` - `r prettyNum(be$upper.ci.B[be$Species == "Engraulis mordax" & be$Stock == "Central" & be$Stratum == "All"],big.mark=",",digits=5)` t) in summer 2019, which was not different from the estimate of 723,826 t [CI~95%~ = 533,548 - 1,015,782; @Stierhoff2019b] but was a nearly five-fold increase from estimates in summer 2016 [151,558 t,  CI~95%~ = 34,806 - 278,024; @Zwolinski2017] and summer 2017 [153,460 t, CI~95%~ = 2,628 - 264,009 t; @Zwolinski2019a]. The length distribution of the stock in summer 2019 had two modes ($L_S$ ~8 and 12 cm), indicating the presence of two dominant year-classes.  

### Pacific Sardine {#discussion-sardine}     
#### Northern stock {#discussion-sardine-biomass-northern}  

The summer 2019 survey sampled most of the potential habitat for the northern stock of Pacific Sardine, and likely most of the stock. The estimated biomass of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine was `r prettyNum(sum(be.sar.n$Biomass), big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be$lower.ci.B[be$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be$Stock == "Northern" & be$Stratum == "All"],big.mark=",",digits=5)` - `r prettyNum(be$upper.ci.B[be$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be$Stock == "Northern" & be$Stratum == "All"],big.mark=",",digits=5)` t) in summer 2019, which was not different than the estimate of 25,148 t [CI~95%~ = 4,480 - 60,551; @Stierhoff2019b] in summer 2018, but had a lower CV (`r prettyNum(be.all$biomass.cv[be.all$Species == 'Sardinops sagax' & be.all$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=1)`% versus 67% in 2018), likely due to the more even distribution of biomass throughout the sampling strata. **[Add more?]**  

A gap in the length distribution of Pacific Sardine between 17 and 24 cm (and between 15 and 18 cm in 2018) is further evidence of poor recruitment in 2016. Similar to 2017 and 2018, few trawls with Pacific Sardine smaller than 10 cm indicates that recruitment was weak again in 2019.  

In recent years, the distribution of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine has been fragmented and its migration has been abbreviated. Despite the recurrent presence of good potential habitat north of Vancouver Island during the summer months (see **Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-potential-habitat)**), the stock has not migrated there since 2013 [@Zwolinski2014].  

#### Southern stock {#discussion-sardine-biomass-southern}  

The potential habitat of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine did not extend into the Southern CA Bight at the time it was sampled (**Fig. \@ref(fig:sardine-potential-habitat)c,d**). Therefore, the `r prettyNum(sum(be.sar.s$Biomass), big.mark=",", digits = 5)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be$lower.ci.B[be$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be$Stock == "Southern" & be$Stratum == "All"], big.mark=",",digits=5)` - `r prettyNum(be$upper.ci.B[be$Species == "Sardinops sagax" & be$Stock == "Southern" & be$Stratum == "All"],big.mark=",",digits=5)` t) biomass estimated in that area was attributed to the southern stock of Pacific Sardine.  

### Pacific Mackerel {#discussion-mack}  

In 2019, the estimated biomass of Pacific Mackerel was `r prettyNum(be.all$Biomass[be.all$Species == 'Scomber japonicus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all$lower.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Scomber japonicus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all$upper.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Scomber japonicus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t), which was greater than the estimate of 8,000 t (CI~95%~ = 1,000-20,000 t) in summer 2013 [@Zwolinski2014] but lower than the estimates of 41,139 t (CI~95%~ = 18,019 -58,425 t) in 2017 [@Zwolinski2019a] and 31,211 t (CI~95%~ = 18,309 - 45,106 t) in 2018 [@Stierhoff2019b]. The species was distributed between Astoria and Cape Mendocino in the north and between Morro Bay and San Diego in the south. Their length distribution had modes at 8 and 32 cm. The first mode is indicative of a newly recruited cohorts, while the largest mode, approaching the maximum length for Pacific Mackerel, probably includes fish from multiple year classes.  

### Jack Mackerel {#discussion-jack}  

In 2019, the estimated biomass of Jack Mackerel was `r prettyNum(be.all$Biomass[be.all$Species == 'Trachurus symmetricus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all$lower.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Trachurus symmetricus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all$upper.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Trachurus symmetricus'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t), a nearly 50% increase from the estimate of 202,471 t (CI~95%~ = 128,718 - 260,175 t) in summer 2018 [@Stierhoff2019b]. Their length distribution had three distinct modes indicating the presence of several distinct year classes. Jack Mackerel was the second most abundant species overall and was most abundant between Newport and Crescent City in the primary survey area, and offshore in the SCB.  

### Pacific Herring {#discussion-herring}  

Pacific Herring in the northeastern Pacific Ocean form a quasi-panmictic population [@Beacham2008], and when they are not spawning nearshore or in bays and estuaries, may be distributed farther offshore along the continental shelf or slope. There are at least four stocks of Pacific Herring off Vancouver Island and WA, separated by spawning times and locations [@DFO2017; @Stick2014]. The Yaquina Bay and Winchester Bay stocks inhabit waters between Newport and Cape Blanco [@ODFW2013].  

The estimated biomass of Pacific Herring off the coast of Vancouver Island, WA, and OR (`r prettyNum(be.all$Biomass[be.all$Species == 'Clupea pallasii'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t; CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all$lower.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Clupea pallasii'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all$upper.ci.B[be.all$Species == 'Clupea pallasii'],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t) represented a more than three-fold increase over the estimates of 63,418 t (CI~95%~ = 29,811 - 103,365 t) in 2017 [@Zwolinski2019a] and 79,053 t (CI~95%~ = 33,103 - 140,218 t) in 2018 [@Stierhoff2019b]. In 2019, Pacific Herring biomass spanned most of the continental shelf within the area sampled, compared to the more patchy and nearshore distribution of biomass observed in the 2017 and 2018 surveys.  

The acoustic-trawl estimates of Pacific Herring are susceptible to uncertainty in species identification, because Pacific Herring may be both demersal and nearshore when spawning, and pelagic when farther offshore. When integrating backscatter over their possible range of depths, echoes may be included from a variety of species with swimbladders, such as a Pacific Hake and rockfishes [@Stanley1999; @Stanley2000], Lingcod (_Ophiodon elongatus_), Alaska Pollock (_Gadus chalcogrammus_), and others [@Rutherford1996]. To mitigate this potential source of uncertainty in the 2019 estimates of Pacific Herring biomass, the maximum integration depth was set to 75 m, similar to analyses conducted for summer 2018, which appeared to reflect a transition between the pelagic herring and other fish communities that occurred deeper.  

# Conclusion {#discussion-conclusion}  

The acoustic-trawl method (ATM) has been used to monitor and directly assess some of the most valuable pelagic and mid-water fish stocks worldwide [e.g., @Coetzee2008; @Karp1994; @Simmonds2009]. In the CCE, ATM surveys have been used to directly assess the biomass and distributions of Pacific Hake [@JTC2014; @Edwards2018], rockfishes [@Starr1996; @Demer2012b; @Demer2012c; @Demer2012d], Pacific Herring [@Thomas2003], and CPS [@Mais1974; @Mais1977; @Hill2017]. Since 2006, ATM surveys of CPS have been evolving into comprehensive ecosystem surveys [@Cutter2008; @Zwolinski2014]. Since 2018, the survey has provided direct assessments of the five principal species of small pelagic fishes in the CCE.

# Offshore biomass estimation {#appendix-biomass-os}  
## Introduction {#appendix-biomass-os-introduction}  

To estimate CPS biomass in offshore waters not routinely sampled during CCE surveys, sampling was also conducted by _`r survey.vessel`_ and two USVs along ~100 nmi-long extensions of compulsory transects spaced ~80 nmi-apart between approximately Florence, OR and San Diego (see **Fig. \@ref(fig:survey-plan)**).

## Discussion  

<!-- In the area between San Francisco and Pt. Conception, sampling from the USV extended _`r survey.vessel`_’s acoustic transects an average of ~0.7 nmi closer to shore. However, this additional sampling amounted to only about 14% of the nearshore area that was unsampled by _`r survey.vessel`_. While 86% of the nearshore area remained unsampled, the measures made closer to shore by the USV contributed only about 1% each to the stock biomasses of Northern Anchovy and Pacific Sardine.   -->

<!-- The CPS-backscatter data from the USV was apportioned to species using the geographically closest trawl-cluster data from _`r survey.vessel`_, but the USV and _`r survey.vessel`_ did not always sample the same regions close in time. This temporal mismatch in sampling could have been a significant source of uncertainty if a significant portion of the CPS backscatter was sampled in the nearshore region. For this survey, however, potential inaccuracies in the apportioning of CPS backscatter to species could amount to only fractions of 1% of the estimated Northern Anchovy and Pacific Sardine biomasses in the areas sampled by both platforms.  -->

A list of Discussion topics to be expanded and/or added-to:

+ The use of two USVs that sampled contemporaneously with _`r survey.vessel`_ increased the efficiency and precision of sampling in the offshore region.
+ The extension of compulsory transect lines sampled by _`r survey.vessel`_ were posed logistical challenges, making it difficult at times to maintain survey progress.
+ Additional trawl samples in the offshore area would improve the partitioning of acoustic backscatter by the species present.  

### Biomass estimates  

+ With the exception of Jack Mackerel, little CPS biomass was observed in the offshore area.
+ The patchy distribution of biomass resulted in estimates with high CVs for Pacific Mackerel (`r prettyNum(be.all.os$biomass.cv[be.all.os$Species == 'Scomber japonicus'],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%) and the southern stock of Pacific Sardine (`r prettyNum(be.all.os$biomass.cv[be.all.os$Species == 'Sardinops sagax' & be.all.os$Stock == "Southern"],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%).

# Nearshore biomass estimation {#appendix-biomass-ns}  
## Introduction {#appendix-biomass-ns-introduction}  

+ Mention previous efforts to estimate nearshore biomass using extrapolation.
+ Mention previous sampling by fishing vessels and USVs in the neashore.
+ List objectives and approach.

## Methods {#appendix-biomass-ns-methods}  

To estimate CPS biomass near shore, where it is too shallow to navigate NOAA ships safely, sampling from _`r survey.vessel`_ was augmented with echosounder and purse-seine sampling from two fishing vessels, and echosounder sampling from a third USV. The coasts of WA and OR were surveyed by F/V _Lisa Marie_; the coasts of WA, OR, and CA (north of Pt. Conception) were surveyed by a USV; and the coasts of the Southern CA Bight (SCB), and Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands were surveyed by F/V _Long Beach Carnage_.

### Echosounder sampling  

Nearshore acoustic sampling was conducted along ~5 nmi-long transects spaced ~5 nmi apart to provide estimates of CPS biomass in shallow, nearshore waters where _`r survey.vessel`_ did not sample. During Legs I and IV, _`r survey.vessel`_ sampling off the coasts of WA and OR and in the Southern CA Bight was augmented with nearshore echosounder and purse-seine sampling from industry fishing vessels, F/V _Lisa Marie_ and _Long Beach Carnage_, respectively. Additionally, a USV conducted echosounder sampling nearshore, between Cape Flattery, WA and Pt. Conception.

# Nearshore biomass extrapolation {#appendix-biomass-nse}  
## Introduction {#appendix-biomass-nse-introduction}  

The ATM-estimates of CPS biomass are for the surveyed area and period. Any biomass outside of this sampling domain is unknown. To explore the potential magnitude of CPS biomass where the ship did not sample, the survey data was extrapolated into the nearshore areas as described below.  

## Methods {#appendix-biomass-nse-methods}  
### Survey Design  

Due to the shallow seabed and other nearshore hazards to navigation, acoustic sampling may not have encompassed the eastern extents of the stocks. To extrapolate biomasses into the unsampled area, distances were calculated for the projections of each transect to the 5-m isobath (**Fig. \@ref(fig:nearshore-estimation)**). The biomass densities along these unsampled transect extensions were assigned the values measured along the sampled transects equal distances from the eastern ends of the transects. As done for the strata sampled offshore, the extrapolated biomasses in the unsampled nearshore strata were calculated using Equations \@ref(eq:biomass-mean) and \@ref(eq:biomass-mean-density).  

(ref:nearshore-extrapolation) Example biomass densities of the `r tolower(stock.ns)` stock of `r spp.common.ns` (_`r spp.ns`_) in stratum `r stratum.ns` throughout the offshore survey region (gray points); the subset of biomass densities used to extrapolate biomass into the unsampled nearshore waters (colored points); and the corresponding offshore (dashed polygon) and nearshore (solid polygon) strata.

Extrapolation of the northern stock of Northern Anchovy biomass into the unsampled, nearshore waters amounts to an estimated `r prettyNum(be.all.nse$Biomass[be.all.nse$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.nse$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t (CI~95%~ = `r prettyNum(be.all.nse$lower.ci.B[be.all.nse$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.nse$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` - `r prettyNum(be.all.nse$upper.ci.B[be.all.nse$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.nse$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=3)` t, CV = `r prettyNum(be.all.nse$biomass.cv[be.all.nse$Species == 'Engraulis mordax' & be.all.nse$Stock == "Northern"],big.mark=",",digits=1)`%; **Table \@ref(tab:biomass-anch-n-nse)**, **Fig. \@ref(fig:nse-biom-dens-anch-n)**).

<!-- ## Discussion {#appendix-biomass-nse-discussion}   -->

<!-- To estimate the magnitude of the northern stock of Northern Anchovy biomass in nearshore areas where the ship could not safely operate [@PFMC2018] (PFMC, 2018), the acoustic samples from _`r survey.vessel`_ were extrapolated to the 5-m isobath, and F/V _Lisa Marie_ acoustically sampled transects to ~7-m depth. Estimates from both the extrapolated and the core areas of the survey totaled less than 1% of the estimated stock biomass. Most of the fishery landings of Northern Anchovy reflect nearshore catches, which were caught opportunistically and limited [@ODFW2017]. Therefore, the estimated nearshore biomass from this survey was likely ephemeral and potentially uninformative for assessment of the stock's total biomass.   -->

<!-- The proportion of the central stock of Northern Anchovy in the unsampled nearshore areas was estimated by extrapolating the acoustic samples from _`r survey.vessel`_ to the 5-m isobath. Due to high Northern Anchovy densities on the eastern ends of multiple transects, the extrapolated proportion was ~33% of the total survey-estimated stock biomass. This extrapolation should not be considered an adjustment to the survey estimate, but rather evidence that the nearshore region needs to be sampled during future surveys.   -->

<!-- To estimate the nearshore biomass of the Pacific Sardine stock off Oregon and Washington, the acoustic samples from _`r survey.vessel`_ were extrapolated to the 5-m isobath, and the USV 1024 acoustically sampled transects to ~5-m depth. Estimates from both the extrapolation and the measurement total less than **1%** of the estimated stock biomass. Off California, the extrapolation of acoustic samples from _`r survey.vessel`_ indicated there were no Pacific Sardine nearshore.   -->
