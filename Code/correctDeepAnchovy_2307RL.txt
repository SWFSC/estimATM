# 1 - Create a column with deep CPS NASC (cps.nasc)
-Done, new column cps.nasc.deep added to nasc.nearshore
# 2 - Create a new cluster file removing all the clusters that do not have anchovy or herring.
 - 
# 3 - Recalculate the acoustic proportions of anchovy so that they sum up to 1;
# Set the acoustic proportions of sardine and mackerel, and any other CPS to 0.
# 4 - Match clusters to the nearest acoustic sample
# 5 - Calculate biomass and numerical densities for the deep CPS NASC
# 6 - Add numerical and biomass densities to the respective vectors from the upper water column
# 7 - Compute estimates using the new combined vector of biomass and numerical densities
