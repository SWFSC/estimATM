## Executive Summary {-}

This report provides: 1) a detailed description of the acoustic-trawl method (ATM) used by NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center for direct assessments of the dominant coastal pelagic species (CPS; i.e.: Pacific Sardine *Sardinops sagax*, Northern Anchovy *Engraulis mordax*, Pacific Mackerel *Scomber japonicus*, Jack Mackerel *Trachurus symmetricus*, and Pacific Herring *Clupea pallasii* in the California Current Ecosystem off the west coast of the United States (U.S.) and sometimes portions of Canada and Baja CA, Mexico; and 2) estimates of the biomasses, distributions, and demographics of those CPS encountered in the survey area between `r survey.start` and `r survey.end` `r survey.year`.

The core survey region, which was sampled by NOAA ship *`r survey.vessel.long`* (hereafter, *`r survey.vessel`*), NOAA ship *Bell M. Shimada* (hereafter, *Shimada*), and three wind-powered uncrewed surface vehicles (Explorer USVs; Saildrone, Inc.), spanned most of the continental shelf between `r survey.landmark.n` and `r survey.landmark.s`. Planned transects were oriented approximately perpendicular to the coast, from the shallowest navigable depth (\~20 m) to a distance of 35 nmi offshore or, if farther, to the 1,000 ftm (\~1830 m) isobath. In the SCB, transects in the core region were extended to approximately 100 nmi. The survey area was initially designed to extend south to Punta Baja off Baja CA and north to Cape Scott off Vancouver Island, Canada, but was necessarily reduced due to a loss of approximately 60% of the 81 sea days allocated aboard *`r survey.vessel`*. An additional 25 sea days were allocated, and 15 days were executed, aboard *Shimada* to to sample in the core region north of Cape Mendocino where *`r survey.vessel.long`* did not sample.

Because navigation by *`r survey.vessel`*, *Shimada*, and the USVs in water shallower than \~20 m was deemed inefficient, unsafe, or both, fishing vessels *Long Beach Carnage* and *Lisa Marie* sampled CPS in the nearshore region, along 2.5 to 5 nmi-long transects spaced 5 nmi apart off the mainland coast of the U.S., between San Diego and Cape Flattery, as well as around Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands in the Southern CA Bight. In the nearshore region, the species composition and CPS length distributions were estimated using catches in daytime purse-seine sets by *Long Beach Carnage* or *Lisa Marie*, whichever vessel was nearest to the acoustically sampled CPS.

The biomasses, distributions, and demographics for each species and stock are for the survey area and period, and therefore may not represent their entire population or stock. Sampling was conducted in core and nearshore regions off Baja CA by IMIPAS (formerly INAPESCA), but the estimates in this report are for U.S. waters only.

## Introduction {#introduction}

In the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), multiple coastal pelagic fish species (CPS; i.e.: Pacific Sardine *Sardinops sagax*, Northern Anchovy *Engraulis mordax*, Jack Mackerel *Trachurus symmetricus*, Pacific Mackerel *Scomber japonicus*, and Pacific Herring *Clupea pallasii*) comprise the bulk of the forage fish assemblage. These populations, which can change by an order of magnitude within a few years, represent important prey for marine mammals, birds, and larger migratory fishes [@Field2001], and some are targets of commercial fisheries.

During summer and fall, the northern stock of Pacific Sardine typically migrates north to feed in the productive coastal upwelling off OR, WA, and Vancouver Island [@Zwolinski2012, and references therein, **Fig.** \@ref(fig:sardine-distribution)]. In synchrony, but separately, the southern stock of Pacific Sardine migrates from Northern Baja CA, Mexico to the Southern CA Bight (SCB) [@Smith2005]. The predominantly piscivorous adult Pacific and Jack Mackerels also migrate north in summer, but go farther offshore to feed [@Zwolinski2014 and references therein]. In the winter and spring, the northern stock of Pacific Sardine typically migrates south to its spawning grounds, generally off Central and Southern CA [@Demer2012] and occasionally off OR and WA [@Lo2011]. These migrations vary in extent with population size; fish age and length; and oceanographic conditions [@Zwolinski2012]. The transition zone chlorophyll front [TZCF, @Polovina2001] may delineate the offshore and southern limit of both Pacific Sardine and Pacific Mackerel habitat [e.g., @Demer2012; @Zwolinski2012], and juveniles may have nursery areas in the SCB, downstream of upwelling regions. In contrast, Northern Anchovy spawn predominantly during winter and closer to the coast where seasonal down-welling increases retention of their eggs and larvae [@Bakun1982]. Pacific Herring spawn in intertidal beach areas [@Love1996]. The northern stock of Northern Anchovy is located off WA and OR and the central stock is located off Central and Southern CA and northern Baja CA. Whether a species migrates or remains in an area depends on its reproductive and feeding behaviors, affinity to certain oceanographic or seabed habitats, and its population size.

Acoustic-trawl method (ATM) surveys, which combine information collected with echosounders and nets, were introduced to the CCE more than 50 years ago to survey CPS off the west coast of the United States (U.S.) [@Mais1974; @Mais1977; @Smith1978]. Following a two-decade hiatus, the ATM was reintroduced in the CCE in spring 2006 to sample the then-abundant Pacific Sardine population [@Cutter2008]. Since then, this sampling effort has continued and expanded through annual or semi-annual surveys [@Zwolinski2014; @Demer2012]. Beginning in 2011, the ATM estimates of Pacific Sardine abundance, age structure, and distribution have been incorporated in the annual assessments of the northern stock [@Hill2017; @Kuriyama2020; @Kuriyama2022b]. ATM estimates are used in assessments of Pacific Mackerel [@Crone2015; @Crone2019] and the central stock of Northern Anchovy [@Kuriyama2022a]. Additionally, ATM survey results have yielded estimated abundances, demographics, and distributions of epipelagic and semi-demersal fishes [e.g., @Swartzman1997; @Williams2013; @Zwolinski2014] and zooplankton [@Hewitt2000].

This document, and references herein, describes in detail the ATM as presently used by NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) to survey the distributions, abundances, and demographics of CPS and their oceanographic environments [e.g., @Cutter2008; @Demer2012; @Zwolinski2014]. In general terms, the contemporary ATM combines information from satellite-sensed oceanographic conditions, multifrequency echosounders, probe-sampled oceanographic conditions, pumped samples of fish eggs, and trawl-net catches of juvenile and adult CPS. The summer survey area is initially defined with consideration to the potential habitat of the northern stock of Pacific Sardine (**Fig.** \@ref(fig:sardine-distribution)), and further expanded to encompass as much of the potential habitat as possible for other CPS present off the West Coast of the U.S. and Baja CA, as time permits.

Along transects in the survey area, multi-frequency split-beam echosounders transmit sound pulses downward beneath the ship and receive echoes from animals and the seabed in the path of the sound waves. Measurements of sound speed and absorption from conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) probes allow accurate compensation of these echoes for propagation losses. The calibrated echo intensities, normalized to the range-dependent observational volume, provide indications of the target type and behavior [e.g., @Demer2009].

(ref:sardine-distribution) Conceptual spring (shaded region) and summer (hashed region) distributions of potential habitat for the northern stock of Pacific Sardine along the west coasts of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The dashed and dotted lines represent, respectively, the approximate summer and spring positions of the 0.2 mg m^–3^ chlorophyll-a concentration isoline. This isoline appears to oscillate in synchrony with the transition zone chlorophyll front [TZCF, @Polovina2001] and the offshore limit of the northern stock Pacific Sardine potential habitat [@Zwolinski2011]. Mackerels are found within and on the edge of the same oceanographic habitat [e.g., @Demer2012; @Zwolinski2012]. The TZCF may delineate the offshore and southern limit of both Pacific Sardine and Pacific Mackerel distributions, and juveniles may have nursery areas in the SCB, downstream of upwelling regions.

Echoes from marine organisms are a function of their body composition, shape, and size relative to the sensing-sound wavelength, and their orientation relative to the incident sound waves [@Cutter2009; @Demer2009; @Renfree2009]. Variations in echo intensity across frequencies, known as echo spectra, indicate the taxonomic groups contributing to the echoes. The CPS, with highly reflective swim bladders, create high intensity echoes of sound pulses at all echosounder frequencies [e.g., @Conti2003]. In contrast, krill, with acoustic properties closer to those of the surrounding seawater, produce lower intensity echoes, particularly at lower frequencies [e.g., @Demer2003]. The echo energy attributed to CPS, based on empirical echo spectra [@Demer2012], are apportioned to species using trawl-catch proportions [@Zwolinski2014].

Animal densities are estimated by dividing the summed intensities attributed to a species by the length-weighted average echo intensity, i.e., the mean backscattering cross-section, from animals of that species [e.g., @Demer2012]. Transects with similar densities are grouped into post-sampling strata that mimic the natural patchiness of the target species [e.g., @Zwolinski2014]. An estimate of abundance is obtained by multiplying the average estimated density in the stratum by the stratum area [@Demer2012]. The associated sampling variance is calculated using non-parametric bootstrap of the mean transect densities. The total abundance estimate in the survey area is the sum of abundances in all strata. Similarly, the total variance estimate is the sum of the variance in each stratum.

The primary objectives of the SWFSC’s ATM surveys are to survey the distributions, abundances, and demographics of CPS, and their abiotic environments in the CCE. Typically, summer surveys are conducted during 50-90 DAS between June and October. When they occur, spring surveys are conducted during 25-40 days-at-sea (DAS) between March and May and focus primarily on the northern stock of Pacific Sardine and the central stock of Northern Anchovy. In summer, the ATM surveys also include the northern stock of Northern Anchovy and Pacific Herring. During spring and summer, biomasses are also estimated for other CPS (e.g., Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, and Round Herring) present in the survey area.

In `r tolower(survey.season)` `r survey.year`, the ATM survey, spanning the west coast of the U.S., was conducted by *`r survey.vessel`* from San Diego to Cape Mendocino, and by *Shimada* between Florence, OR and Cape Flattery. Between Pt. Conception and Cape Flattery, along adaptive transects not sampled by *`r survey.vessel`* or *Shimada*, three wind-powered uncrewed surface vessels (Explorer USVs; Saildrone, Inc.) conducted acoustic sampling. From San Diego to Cape Flattery, sampling from fishing vessels *Lisa Marie* and *Long Beach Carnage* was used to estimate the biomasses of CPS in the nearshore regions, where sampling by *`r survey.vessel`*, *Shimada*, and USVs was not possible or safe.

Presented here are: 1) a detailed description of the ATM used to survey CPS in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) off the west coast of the U.S.; and 2) estimates of the abundances, biomasses, size structures, and distributions of CPS, specifically the northern and southern stocks of Pacific Sardine; the central and northern stocks of Northern Anchovy, Pacific Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Herring for the core and nearshore survey regions in which they were sampled. Additional details about the survey may be found in the survey report [@Renfree2024]. A complementary survey off Baja CA by IMIPAS used approximately the same sampling protocol. Data from that survey, including biomass estimates for CPS in those core and nearshore regions, are reported elsewhere [@Vallarta2024].

The SWFSC's survey was conducted with the approval of the Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores (SRE, Diplomatic note UAN0995/2023), the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI; Authorization: EG0022023, through official letter 400./91/2023), Unidad de Planeación y Coordinación Estratégica de la Secretaría de Marina (SEMAR; Letter no AI/2301/23), Unidad Coordinadora de Asuntos Internacionales (UCAI) de la Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT; Letter UCAI/01519/2023), Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM; Letter ICML/DIR/210/2023), Unidad de Concesiones y Servicios del Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones (IFT; Letter IFT/223/UCS/DG-AUSE/3925/2023), and the Comisión Nacional de Acuacultura y Pesca (CONAPESCA; Permit: PPFE/DGPPE.-04052/100523).
